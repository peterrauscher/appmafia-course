### Transcript

Welcome to the first lesson introduction video of App Mafia. I'm going to go over a brief background on who we are and what we intend to teach here. So this is the App Mafia Playbook. With zero investors and minimum coding experience, we each built multi-million dollar app businesses. NGL was built, I think, a bit over four years ago by Hunter. It makes $30 million a year. Riz, GPT, UMax, and CaliI were built by myself. And then Zach on CaliI as well, which made $3.5, $3.5, and $40 million a year respectively. And Quitter was built, I think, almost exactly one year ago now by Conor and Alex, and they make $6 million a year. So this is all total to over $80 million a year, just with the power of code and small teams. So as you see here, Zach's 18, Alex's 19 Conors 23, I'm 24, and Hunter is 26, I think. We all started bootstrapped, small teams like one to three people. We were built recently, and we all make millions of dollars a year in profit. So why build apps? Today, you do not need to have a CS degree or to raise venture capital to do it. You just need direction and execution. I cannot emphasize this enough. AI makes it easier than ever before to build apps. AI apps can solve more problems for users from the advent of the app store until the release of chat GPT. The change in existing technology was pretty minor. There weren't that many new products that could be built. AI completely changes that, turns it upside down. And finally, social media algorithms amplify reach. It's easier than ever before to be one individual with a creative idea and to reach millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, even over a billion people. Each of my apps has reached well over a billion people on social media. The structure of this course will be going through the four Ds of software. First D is I Dation. The second is Design. The third is Development. And the fourth is Distribution. Now, throughout this course, we are going to give very clear examples, experiences that we have had within each of these domains, the tools that we use, and our processes that we believe apply to almost everybody that is looking to build and scale a consumer app. In the next lesson, I'll dive into the tech stack that we use. And then after that, we will get into the first module, ideation, and coming up with your idea. Feel free to skip around. I would probably watch on two X speed personally. And yeah, bounce to whatever is interesting. Follow your gut. Follow your curiosities. Some other information on the internet, but do know that most people that make content within this domain have not achieved nearly the level of success that just any individual involved in that mafia has. This is the gold standard. And yeah, I think as of the release of this video, it will be 100% free. The launch, you know, to hit the elephant in the room, the launch on Twitter was obviously very, very viral and very controversial. But that was all intended. It's all an act. The play here is mind share. If we can be known by the masses, and yet provide something that is extremely helpful. I think that it positions us well to build the best tools for the present and future of all app builders. At the end of the day, I believe app builders are simply bringing AI and new human experiences into the hands of billions of people. I hope that that starts here. We hope that it starts with high value information to help you and everybody alongside yourself. Achieve your goals in your journey of building apps. So that is my spiel for this first lesson. I'll see you guys in the next lesson where I explain the tech stack. And then we'll jump right on in to ideation.

People are always asking about our tech stack and the different tools that we use in the process of building and scaling apps. So here it is. Quick disclaimer, we are sponsored by some of these apps. But we first came up with the list of all the most important products that we used. And then we reached out to them and we said, hey, which of you guys want to have an affiliate code? You do get a discount with some of them, so I would highly recommend using the link provided or the code Mafia at checkout. Alright, let's get started. So you'll notice that we don't have any for ideation. I don't use any tools currently in the process of ideation. For design, we use Figma. It's the only tool that you should be designing your consumer apps in. And then ZitLac Media when we need additional design bandwidth for design sprints. Now, if I'm hiring a designer, I'll usually use Upwork or Dribble to source them. For development, for the front end, we use cursor, Xcode, and SwiftUI. I've gone back and forth between SwiftUI and React Native, but I've pretty much settled at. Build first and SwiftUI. And then if you're at a successful, build an Android version, either in React Native and or Kotlin. For back end, we use Superbase and OpenAI. Superbase as our database. And then OpenAI for AI functionality. Now you can also use Firebase or AWS or Anthropic or GROC. But these two seem to be the gold standard right now. Superwall, I cannot emphasize this enough. You should always use Superwall. I have been promoting them for the longest time. Only just recently, instead of a sponsorship deal with them. But they're the most important product to use. I use it for every single app. It is an absolute non-negotiable. Mixed panel for analytics, apps fire for attribution of your paid ads. For distribution, we've recently set up an exclusive deal with creators' corner. We are the only app studio, I guess, that they will work with. They are by far the best in the game. There's no contest. They've only been doing TikTok shop pretty much for the past couple of years. Because that's where creators make more money. But I'm really good friends with Jimmy Farley, one of the founders. And he agreed to set up an exclusive deal. They will not work with everybody. But if you are lucky enough to be able to hire their creators, they are no question the best in the game. They're the only UGC agency that I've ever worked with that actually produced massive returns. Every single other one, almost everyone that you see on Twitter, they don't do it. They're not actually good creators' corner it is. Groey, good for tracking. Good for tracking the results of individual posts. So influencer UGC gives you better data. Founders are, is so important. You're going to hire VA's from them. They source VA's. Cal AI, we've about 35 employees. Over half of them are VA's from Founders Arm. VA's are important for reaching out to influencers, managing UGC creators. And almost any monotonous task that you have in your business. Any other VA sourcing agency that I've used cannot compare to Founders Arm. Valid AI, good for paid ad agency. Most have worked with Aunt Good. They're pretty good, so I'd recommend them. Most have. So this is kind of like the tools that you're going to use in the process of running your business. Parker for banking, we're working with Parker to set up instant payouts at a lower interest rate than anywhere else on the market for app developers. If you've ever been paid out, you understand that the 45-day net payout cycle sucks. It's horrible. It makes it almost impossible to scale in the early days. So how do you recommend Parker? Alternatively, you can also use Mercury. Stripe Atlas for setting up your LLC or C-Corp slack for managing your team. You might want to use iMessage or Discord that's fine. You can use them in the early days, but as you scale, I usually just recommend using Slack. And then Rome as well. Rome, you definitely don't need unless you have a team grid and like five to ten people. But Rome is essentially a virtual office. It makes it a lot easier to manage your team as you scale. So please use the links attached here and or use the code mafia. But yeah, this is our tech stack. If you have any questions, let us know. We can update this as we move forward in the future.

### Transcript

All right, what's up, Pussy's? Welcome to the start of our first module of this course, ideation. To start off with ideation, we're going to be going over case studies. I'm a big believer in the principle that like the best way to learn to ride a bike is to ride a bike. You might scrape yourself, you might get cut, but you're going to learn better. Then like studying the underlying mechanics and physics of how bikes work, it's like get on the bike and ride. Now I think approaching building apps is a little bit different in that you have to invest significantly more time and resources into actually building and marketing and designing an application. But what you can do instead is take a look at examples of apps that have succeeded. Apps that have been built quickly and made a lot of money. So that's what we're going to do here today. So the apps listed here, almost every single one, makes over a million dollars per year in profit, was started by one to three people, has received zero funding and has been built in the past three years. Now I can verify this because about almost half of the apps here have been built by somebody in AppMafia and the majority of the rest, we know the founders personally. The reason that we selected these in addition to our own experience with them is because there are a lot of apps on the App Store where you can, you know, you can scroll the charts and you find apps like My Fitness Pal or apps like, you know, maybe Impulse or different apps that make millions and millions of dollars a month. But some of the key issues with studying apps like that is they were built ten years ago and they've raised tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and sure they make money and sure they may have been founded by a couple of people. But it's very common that these case studies just aren't going to be that applicable to the people watching this content. And now whether you already have a successful app or you are completely new to this space, these are the apps that have really sort of taken over the industry by storm over the course of the past few years. A lot of these apps apply AI to bring new products to life, whereas others just take advantage of other trends or other, you know, consumer interests. Now, a very important disclaimer here is that there are many other app categories that we did not include here. But these are app categories where we have domain expertise and also will also currently present a lot of opportunity and will continue to present a ton of opportunity in the future. So we're going to focus on this within the course of this course. But there are many other apps that are worth studying. So do your own research. At the top of this first row, you'll see this sort of like higher order problems. We'll get into that a little bit in some of the future lessons about how to kind of determine what problems to work on and how you're going to go about solving them. But for the sake of this first video, I'm going to run through some of these apps, explain a little bit of the background on why they worked and kind of just get the creative juices flowing. So let's get into it. All right, Rizapp number one. First problem that we're looking at is dating. I'm actually going to talk a lot about that in a future lesson why dating is so important. But Riz is actually our first competitor for the first app that I built. Riz GPT. I was in school and I had a friend who was using dating apps a lot. Always getting with different girls and whatnot. And he would be like, dude, what should I say to this girl in a very normal casual way. And this was shortly after ChatsyPetit came out and I'm like, man, we, I could very easily build an app to generate responses. And it kind of spring out of curiosity. I'm like, I wonder how good ChatsyPetit would do given proper prompt engineering. And so I started working on this app. And as I'm starting to work on it, I did a little bit of market research. And Riz was our number one competitor. Riz had already launched, but they weren't popular. They'd done maybe like 20,000 downloads, something like that. But they are a great case study. The founders have a good amount of experience. Before we had jumped into the scene with Riz GPT, I actually go ahead and pull that up right now. Plug AIs that I built. We had to rename from Riz GPT because of a lawsuit from Riz. No bad blood there. But we launched and like we did everything wrong that you could possibly imagine. The app was named Riz GPT-Production when you downloaded it. I had to open AI API keys stored in the front end. It was a complete mess. But what Riz GPT, Plug AI and the Riz app do, they enabled you to upload a screenshot of a conversation that you're having with a girl. And it'll help give you recommendations on what to set. And there's been some innovation over the course of the past year in terms of what the product actually looked like. Looks like. But it touches on the key thread which is highlighted in a South Park episode actually, which is like, it's not always easy to know what to say to girls. It's actually very hard for a high proportion of guys. And AI in this case can help kind of augment that. So we launched, we did some underground influencer promos that ended up ripping. And then we started into a bloodbath war with the Riz app. Honestly, I think Plug AI slash Riz GPT and Riz are kind of the first big players in the new AI product crossed with organic social media marketing sort of strategy. I think both. So Riz GPT, we make a little bit over 300 km on right now. I think Riz is probably somewhere in the range of four to five hundred. But definitely worth studying these products. So that's a little bit of a background there in terms of how we, what this part of the industry looks like. Okay, now we've got another relatively new app T. T has been absolutely ripping. T is number one on the app store for a little while. There's a little bit distinct from a lot of apps that we're going to touch on and that most of these are kind of single player apps. But I wanted to include it because I think that it highlights a very important component of user and consumer psychology, which is T kind of plays on this concept of FOMO to some extent. You can even see it in their messaging. It's like they say that they're helping women date safe. No, it's really an anonymous gossip forum. But it's a very intelligent product decision. So we're studying and keep moving on. Cali, Cali is the app that Zach and I built together. Cali does a little bit over $3 million a month in revenue. Quick background on this. AI Calary Trackers were beginning to become popular shortly after the release and popularization of the vision models. So the GPT vision and whatnot. This was the end of 2023 around the time I built UMax, which I'll touch in in a second. Touch on in a second. Now we saw players entering the space, but we felt like no one was really doing it right. And from product nor distribution lens. So we did it. We were like, what's the simplest possible fucking product we can build? We saw these tailwinds. They're very important to sort of identify if you want to come up with new ideas and take advantage of new technologies and new consumer behaviors. We're like, what's the simplest product we can build? Take a picture. Get your calories. That was it. There was one one button. And then from there we innovated and grew and now we are almost certainly the number one most popular AI Cali tracker. We're like competing. We're head to head. Let's see, pull this up with my fitness pal. We're like kind of consistently ranking above them right now. So it's pretty cool. So not just AI calorie tracker, but calorie tracker as a whole. All right, UMax. UMax is my favorite personal case study. You can see we got, we got me right here. Pretty cool, pretty cool. We've done almost 30 million downloads across platforms. So Android and iOS UMax, what I think everybody can learn from is the point that I just touch on of identifying tailwinds. Looks Maxing was becoming incredibly popular. It was just taking over social media for men age like 13 through 25. It was on everybody's feet. And I saw it and I was like, man, this is the perfect place to build a product, perfect sort of niche. And it was also perfect timing. The GPT vision API, as I mentioned, was released in the end of 2020. I think I had said, yeah, no, this was 2023, end of 2023. And I was like, this opportunity is too good. I need to figure out how to build this product right now because the API hadn't been released. So this is back in September, October of 2023. And I know that the vision API was coming up, but I also knew that there was going to be competition. So I'm like, okay, what can I do to be ahead of the curve? So I built the entire product with no functional API. The entire product was ready to go. And then the moment that the API got released, I plugged in the URL and I submitted to the App Store within a few days. I was approved. And I already had influencer deals lined up on contingency, so I didn't pan anybody ahead of time. Okay, long rambles, but what's the takeaway here? The takeaway is that as we see these continuous advancements in AI technology, so this is an example of image analysis. We're seeing video analysis coming to play, video generation, image generation. And we're going to see a whole new set of modalities that can be applied to create experiences like never before. Facial analysis was somewhat possible before AI vision APIs, but it was using more traditional ML vision models, which just like you can't get the same performance and it's way more expensive and difficult to build. Now it's as simple as plain text, English prompting. So study you max. Onward. I'm going to start moving a little bit faster so that this isn't take too long. But I hope you guys are kind of picking up on how these ideas come to play, as well as how important time is. We got Quitter, Connor and Alex, amazing fucking app. One of my favorite in the industry right now. For them, it's not taking advantage of some new AI technology. It's looking at an incredibly, incredibly important problem that our generation faces. And not just our generation, that man as a whole face nowadays, which is lust and pornography. Whether you think it's good or bad, a lot of people think it's bad. A lot of people jerk off and watch porn and they know it's bad for them, at least as individuals. Connor and Alex recognize this. They saw how big of a problem it was and they went to solve it. They drew an inspiration from some previously successful apps in terms of marketing, namely like the apps that I built as well as Zach. And then they created a completely sort of new experience. They took a look at apps that help people track sobriety. And then they embedded that within a product to help quit porn. Alcoholism has been an issue for longer than pornography has. And so therefore, there's been more innovation on the UX side of how to solve alcoholism, alcoholism relative to how to solve pornographic addiction. So yeah, sweet app. They are going to continue to rise in the rankings. Okay, Opal, similar, very similar. Actually Opal may have been more of a case study for quitter than the sobriety tracking apps. Nevertheless, similar, very, very similar products, people are addicted to jerking off, people are also addicted to their phones. Solve that, make content, people pay. Great. All right, Bible chat, different thread of your spirituality. We're in a meeting crisis. I mean, people have heard this. We're in a meeting crisis nowadays. People are increasingly looking for ways to become more spiritual. Bible chat helps people connect with their Christianity. Awesome. Great product. You also see this for Muslims and Jews as well. Different thread rather than religion, Astra helps people solve it, solve the spirituality, whatever that they want to find in their life through astrology. Also becoming increasingly popular. This is actually built by my co-founders of Riz Gpt. You see, they are vert ventures. If we go back to Plague AI, this was vert media. We built Riz Gpt, Plague AI together. I went off and built U-Max. They went off and built Astra. All right. Minutes AI, AI note taking. I'm sure everyone's familiar with this industry. It's one of the most popular, sort of clear productivity increase value ads from AI. Minutes is one example, founded by a small team. There's Turbo. There is Otter or something. And a bunch of others, pretty straightforward. People don't like to pay attention during meetings or school or team. Okay. Quizzard. Very, very common AI homework helper. Super simple. Take a picture of your homework. Nice, pretty UI. I feel like that's pretty self-explanatory why it works. It's built by O'Leave Labs. O'Leave is a pretty cool company. They've got like another AI note taker, as I'd mentioned, with Minutes AI. One category is, or success category is great. It's like, all right, let's help you make money. Let's help you be more successful in your career. I think you can build a product that tangibly helps people make those incremental improvements. It's very obvious why they would pay for it. Social validation. Okay. Now, this is a slightly different territory that we're getting into. So generally, we recommend against building social apps. There's so much harder to build. We'll talk more about that later in the course. But there's an interesting subset of social sort of companion products. So HunterBuiltNGL. NGL has done, I think, 300 million downloads. One of the most popular apps in the world. They are a social companion app. You can post your NGL links on your Snapchat and Instagram story, get anonymous messages. So rather than build full on social platforms, like if you're here in this course, you should probably already know by now. But the probability that you succeed building a full social platform is extremely low. I don't say that to discourage you. Like, if you want to do it, you can do it. But I say that just so you know what you're getting yourself into. So if you're going to build social, social companion is usually the highest probability of finding success. Lock it. Lock it and enables you to like share images with your friends. Kind of stay up to date, put it on your home screen. Cool product. They're also one of the most popular apps in the world. I think that they've done tens of millions, maybe like 100 million plus downloads. Now laps once again, one of these sort of like, one of these like non-full fledged social platforms, but rather like social ex utility. So same boat, take these sort of like disposable camera aesthetic, whatever images with your friends, share them. Cool. All right. That is it for case studies. Lot of rambling. But it's one to give you guys a little bit of a background on how I think through these products so that you guys can refer back to this if you want throughout the rest and the remainder of our course. To be honest, like even beyond us referencing these apps, whenever we are lecturing and providing information, you should refer back to them. You want to start training this muscle. When I first built RISGPT, I had like pretty much zero understanding of this space. Number one, most valuable thing I ever did was begin to study these apps. As it started to grow, I picked up on the fact that each time I downloaded a successful app and used it, I would uncover some new sort of strategy, be it UI, be it marketing, be it general UX, engineering, whatever. That would add a, you know, 5 plus percent increase. For example, with RISGPT, like after we downloaded a few different apps, we realized that everyone was using Superwall and split testing their paywalls. And that three X star revenue as soon as we implemented it and began using a harder paywall. Notifications, analytics, like these are all things that we did not have set up from day one. But when you take this course, you'll learn how to do all this. Okay, that wraps this up. Now we're going to go all the way down to the very bottom. We started at a general high level overview of these apps all the way down to the bottom of the very, very, very fundamentals of coming up with your idea and determining what idea you should actually build and how these people, myself included, how we all came up with hours using these sort of frameworks. Okay, part two soon. I want to redo that. Okay, that's lesson one. I'll see you guys in lesson two.

### Transcript

All right, welcome back, lesson 1.0.1, idea versus execution. Quick note, you might see that my camera is like, might be a different size. I don't know, there might be production inconsistencies throughout this course. Admittedly, I'm not an expert on production quality, but I am an expert on coming up with great ideas for apps. So let's talk about that. Idea versus execution is as classic and old a debate as chicken versus egg when it comes to business. So what matters more by non-answer, but the honest truth of it is that they matter equally. They're honestly just different things. Your idea will determine the outcome curve of your applied execution. Whereas your execution will determine where you land on that curve. Execution is the input. The idea is the structure of the equation itself. For those of you that aren't familiar with the term curve, curve essentially just means equation. It just means like what is the sort of possible set of outcomes look like based on your amount of input. Okay, so good idea. You will get more outcome per unit of input or how well you execute relative to a bad idea. This should be pretty self evident. But as usual, there are virtually infinite shapes of this curve. It's not so one dimensional. So you can work on ideas that are exponential. Social apps often take this form factor. If you execute really well, you see this like incredible exponential outcome when you have higher attention, high K factor. But if you don't execute well, the outcome is most likely to be low. The thing that's often difficult here is it's pretty difficult to see the difference between this curve right here for exponential and a bad idea. So you might think that you're in the early stages of what will be exponential. Right? See it at four units of execution. We see about the same sort of outcome output. But you don't know if you're close to take off exponential growth or if you're dead on arrival. In my experience. Man, it really depends. But in my experience, I try to target fast growth or at the very minimum, these sort of good idea, linearly, linearly tracking up. As you become more skilled as an entrepreneur, builder, just business person as a whole, you'll be able to more easily recognize the difference between exponential and bad. And so you'll be able to kind of work on products with a longer time horizon and larger feedback loops. And so as you see here, as with most maximum in business, this is still an oversimplification. Because it's just like your execution is so multi-dimensional, there's so many factors that go into it, the amount of resources that you have to play, what your time horizon looks like, which I think actually brings us to here. And coming up with the best possible idea, these are questions that are extremely important to have very clear answers to. What is your desired outcome? Do you care more about the problem that you are solving or the reward that you get for solving it? A good litmus test here is, you know, if you worked on the problem for 10 years and you never made much money from it, maybe just enough to last, would you be happy? On the other hand, like instead of doing that, would you prefer to ignore that problem and just take a million dollars right now? If your answer is the latter, you probably care a little bit more about the reward that you get for solving it. It doesn't mean that you don't work on problems that you don't still care about, but just that, you know, maybe you do care about making a lot of money. And that's like, there's no harm in that. The harm is when, you know, you make you sacrifice and take immoral action for the pursuit of it, right? But in and of itself wanting to make money is not a bad thing. What's your timeline? Do you need to make the money in the next three months? Or can you work on it for a year? Two years before you make any cash. When I first got started off, my timeline was zero, dude. Like I needed to make money as quickly as possible. I'd like $2,000 in my bank account, but all of that into RISGPT. My brother was giving me loans for groceries. There was no runway. My entire goal with RISGPT, my entire goal was to make $50,000 over the course of 12 months, just so that I could continue to pay living expenses so that I could keep being an entrepreneur. I actually have this written down. And there's, I have a tweet about it on my Twitter. Anyways, what are your resources and constraints? Now similar to timeline, it's like, do you have a lot of capital to invest? That might be one of your resources. Your constraint might be that you only have three hours a day free. Maybe you still have to work a full-time job. Maybe you have a family. Maybe you're a student. So these are very, very important problems to identify because these will impact your problem identification. Or you want to consider these things ahead of time. If you want to build something that is technically very, very, very difficult, then you're going to want more resources with regards to engineering capabilities. Either you or a co-founder or whomever need to be very skilled. You know, if your resource is, you know, you have a lot of money, maybe you can pursue problems that generally require significantly more capital to get going and have a longer development timeline. So yeah, identify your resources and constraints and we'll touch on kind of these specific things in a second. And then additionally, you want to consider what the curve looks like, right? Based on timeline, you might pursue different sort of outcome curves. Okay, so let's get tangible here. RizGPT and UMACS grew fast but flatlined. The goal with both of those products was how do I start making money as quickly as possible? Because I don't have cash to continue putting in or even cash to continue paying for my living expenses. And so as a result, I identified problems that I thought I could solve very easily, both with regards to the amount of capital invested and the amount of engineering difficulty. RizGPT was a significantly easier engineering product than UMACS was. So as my capabilities as an engineer increased, I'd like to think that I was like one of the first vibe coders, because AI actually wrote the vast majority of the code for both RizGPT and UMACS. But as my technical abilities increased, so did the technical complexity of the products that I worked on. Now, after UMACS had kind of blew up and was doing really well, that came to me and he was like, I want to build an app with you. And he sent me a list of ideas. And so at this point in time, I knew that I was going to make over a million dollars in profit from my products. And so when he sent a list of ideas, also this should say plug. Sorry about that. But Zach sent me a list of ideas and I said to him, I was like, listen, I want to work on something that has more upside. Otherwise, it's not going to be worth my time at all. And so I went through his list of ideas and there were a number that were more similar to RizGPT and UMACS in total possible outcome. But I saw a calorie tracker was included and I said, I want to work on this. Or this is what we should work on together. I just want you to know that we're probably not going to see the same takeoff as UMACS. UMACS hit over $700,000 in monthly revenue within two months. Now, I always kind of knew that that was possible given the state of that niche and the virality of the product. With Cal AI, we were going against an incumbent. We were working with a relatively rudimentary technology. We required more capital, more engineering resources, and more overall effort to get it to grow. But it had much higher upside because if we could get to the point of really competing with my fitness pal, they were making, I think, $20 million a month at the time and I think that they still are. I knew that it was a bigger market as a whole, right? A product that more people are willing to pay for. Calorie tracking is just objectively bigger than like facial analysis looks maxing. It might not be forever, who knows, but at the time that was the case. And so these projects went exactly as I expected. I know with other projects I miscalculated a story I have not told too much was the college marketplace app that I built before risk GPT. This was a grave and major miscalculation. Alex Lyman, my co-founder and I and then Evan Dre as well joined later as a co-founder identified the problem on college campuses of the fact that students were using group me to buy and sell use clothing. And there were a number of, I think, false premises on which we operated. But not the least of which was that we were trying to build a local social marketplace. This is one of the most common pitfalls of new app developers, which is I identify this problem in my local community. So I will solve it for my local community. But it's extremely hard. Because not only is it social, but you're also constrained by geography. So you have to create pervasive sort of use within individual bubbles and then across bubbles as well. So when you scale up at different schools, in this case for our college marketplace, we had to go figure out how to solve the cold start problem again and again. Now, there are benefits to this. If you solve it, you know, you've got a strong moat, but we didn't realize how difficult it would be. So we put over a year into the project. We launched at two lane and went reasonably well. Then we went to other schools and it kind of was dead on arrival. It just didn't really grow. We didn't have the same level of connections. The product didn't have high retention. We did not have a high K factor. It was solving a relatively minor problem, which I'm actually going to touch on in the next section. Miscalculations can cause you years of your life. Seriously, it's like you pick the wrong product. You don't identify this curve. Well, right. We were operating within either exponential or bad idea curve. In retrospect, it was clearly bad idea. We kept telling ourselves that it was exponential. So this lesson is very theoretical about determining what ideas to work on, but it is overwhelmingly important. I like. I actually experienced this problem. It leaves him out when people come to me and they're like, hey, I have this idea for an app. Can I get your thoughts? And I want to support them and be a positive influence and be like, you got it, man. You're going to, you're going to fucking, you know, you're going to succeed and they start working on it. And they think that it's going to be exponential. But the whole time I'm like, it's not a good idea. And. It's hard because that, you know, I don't really know how to say it straight. Like, dude, you should work on something else. But I try my best to do that. I'm actually really grateful for the college marketplace app that we built. And I think that's when everyone else is just positive. Like, you're going to do it, bro. We believe in you. A successful entrepreneur, Harry Gestetner. He was a good friend, great guy. He was like, guys, I would, I would fucking move on. And we moved on. And I'm actually like, it was one of the best decisions of my life because it led to everything else that occurred after the fact building risk, GPT and then all the future products. And so these are all important questions to kind of ask yourself. And I think I started to touch into this. But as you come up with the idea, you start brainstorming. You got to ask yourself, like, what is the execution going to tangibly look like here? So similar to the resources and constraints in terms of, you know, the tangible resources, time, money, whatever it may be. You need to look at the subset of skills that are required. Right. What does your team have? What do you have? Okay. So for social apps. As I gave the example of the college marketplace app I built called Holly. To be honest, Alex, Evan and I, we were all very, very good at distribution as has become evident with the products that we've built since specifically social media distribution. But what we weren't very good at was design and development. I actually kind of forgot this, but I have this stuff written out here. So, so we weren't very good at design development, which are extremely important for social apps. You might think that social apps are distribution heavy, but that's actually not the case. A properly built social app will have high k factor and higher attention, which are design and development challenges rather than distribution. If you build the social app right, and you advertise it correctly, it'll kind of continue to grow on its own. Now emerging markets are largely designed and distribution heavy. It's just UMax and RizGPT. The reason that they're not development heavy is because I mean, it's a new, you're building a new product. Sure, you need to get it to work. And sometimes it will be development heavy if it's like leveraging a very, very new technology that's technically sophisticated. But more often than not in this consumer domain. It's design heavy, not in that you need amazing UI, but you need great UX, right? If it's an emerging market, if it's a new product where there does not exist, exist precedent on how to build it and what it should look like, you have to kind of pioneer that on your own. So this was once again RizGPT and UMax, we pioneered the UX. There was a little bit of precedent that we borrowed on, but it was more design heavy UX specifically. And then distribution should be obvious for emerging sectors, specifically for like utility apps is what I'm referring to with a commercial legacy, social being its own utility meaning single player. Distribution heavy because you're producing a product that nobody really knows about. So you're going to have to figure out how to convince people why they should download it. First, you need to figure out how to put in front of their face, make it interesting enough for people to engage with on social media or other platforms. And then second, you have to figure out how to convert them to actually download a pet. Now, legacy sectors, this would be an example of Cal AI. Cal AI was a mix between legacy and emerging. So like the market itself of calorie tracking was legacy, but then the AI component was emerging. So it was new. But if you're competing with incumbents, it's often development or engineering heavy because you need to build a really great product. If there are already existing products on the market and yours isn't at least as good on a product side of things, it's not going to not going to grow usually. It's less design heavy because you have precedent. You can go find that comparable product, take the screenshots, put it in Figma. And there's less innovation required if you're just competing with already existing companies. This is kind of like the idea of like second moveers advantage. I do not recommend being a copycat. And there are a lot of reasons for that that will likely touch on in the future. But if you are going to be competing with incumbents, your development does have to be on point. And then of course, distribution has to be on point because people probably already know about the existing product. And so you have to figure out how to kind of out distribute them. Finish up on the story about the college marketplace app and risk GBT. You know, wrong subset of skills, wrong product idea. This I think genuinely just shows the power of working on the right idea and properly determining expectations. And resources constraints timeline outcome, these sort of questions are so incredibly important. I cannot emphasize them enough. You might be like, this is bullshit. I can't believe I pay for this course. He's just talking that idea of his execution. But it's so real. It's so important. I spent over a year of my life working on the wrong thing because I did not really understand all what I just spoke about. And then I changed and I hit 80 KMRR in three fucking days. Please, please, please, whatever you do, take this message to heart, take this unit to heart. This is the very foundation of the framework that you should use when determining what ideas to work on. All right. In the next section, we're going to get into human psychology and how to actually begin identifying the ideas with which you can apply these frameworks to. Peace out.

### Transcript

All right, lesson three or lesson 1.0.2, we're going over human psychology. So previously we went through some case studies that can serve as inspiration in your process of coming up with ideas and building apps. And then we went over the trade-offs of idea versus execution and using that framework with when you're coming up with ideas, determining which are worth working on and pursuing. I wanted to start with that because that will kind of narrow down the set of ideas that you looked work on. But in the process of actually uncovering the ideas that are valuable and are going to work within that set, I think the best place to start is human psychology. Now this is probably the last very theoretical framework that we are going to go over before we jump into the actual tangible identification of problems and ideas to work on. So to start here, I want you to ignore everything that you have learned up to this point about human psychology. And I want to begin and sort of re-teach everything from a first principle perspective. Now if you already have a very deep understanding of psychology, this unit may not be all that important for you. But I think that it's always very valuable to go back to the very basics. What is the biological imperative? The biological imperative asserts that every living being exists to pass on its genes. This drives all biological human and other life-form behavior. As we see here, this is the fundamental univaction that drives every living being. From single-cell organisms to multicell to complex life, we all exist to pass on our genes. Everything that we know about human psychology and more importantly for building apps, consumer behavior is just an abstraction of this concept. Now we see this truth in its most extreme form through the fact that animals will literally sacrifice their own survival to reproduce or protect their offspring. Some animals will die in the process of reproduction. I think salmon is one classic example. And then others will die to protect their offspring. This should not come a surprise to any of us that are humans. Very classic mythology, you die, you take the bullet to protect your child. I would do it, I'm sure most people watching do this would do it, it's because we want to pass on our genes. Now this is complex, it extends beyond just passing on our children. We want our children to survive and grow up healthy to continue to pass down generation after generation after generation. I think that Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a very culturally popular but also more nuanced representation of this principle. The biological imperative is very simple. As Maslow's hierarchy of needs brings this up a couple levels of abstraction and develops it further beyond just live and reproduce but it says, okay, physiological needs to continue surviving are most important and then safety, security. And then we get into intimate relationship, friends, prestige, feelings of accomplishment and self actualization at the very top. The key takeaway here is that survival is solved, okay, for the biological imperative we exist to pass on our genes that means we exist to continue living and to reproduce. Continue living is solved largely. Now this isn't true for all humans but if you're watching this it's solved for you and solve for the majority of people who you are going to target as your customers. So since survival is solved we should seek to increase the health status, meaning and quality, slash quantity of romantic partners for our potential customers. Solve the biggest problems first. The closer you are to the biological imperative, the lower you are on the pyramid that is Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the easier it will be to sell your product. Everything I just said for the past few minutes boils down to that. Solve major problems. Solve the key things that people want to get out of their life. And I would go so far as to assert that it is almost always easier and more lucrative and higher probability of building a successful product when you solve 10% of a major problem rather than 100% of a minor problem. Okay, so major problems. Like I stated above here, the lower we have in the Maslow's hierarchy of needs the more of a major problem it is. If for example, you know, let's set aside apps for a second, if there exists a marketplace where people that are coming to this marketplace don't have reliable sources of food, then the product that you want to solve is probably food. Everybody is going to purchase that from you. When it comes to software, physiological and safety needs are largely not problems that we solve. So we go to the next most important. We go to intimate relationships. We go to status. We go to health. There's health obviously, you know, somewhat physiological in nature, but the health that we're talking about is increasing feelings of wellness rather than just survival. Okay. So if we want to solve a major problem such as finding a romantic partner, a, this is written wrongly at this real quick, a 10% solution here would be an AI dating app that suggests better responses. Okay. Go back to the case studies. This is just Riz. This is Plague AI, Riz GPT. Now on the flip side, if we're not solving major problems, we're probably solving minor problems. For example, splitting a dinner bill evenly. Okay. Now what's like the fundamental problem here? Saving along the lines of like fairness, it's also like saving money, right? But this is a major abstraction of the underlying problem of like making money, which is like related to having high status and this concept of fairness, right? It's convoluted. It's over intellectualized. And I want, I want to harp on that word over intellectualized. This is one of the major problems that I see people experience when they're building consumer applications. They over intellectualize and abstract too far out from the actual underlying problem that they're trying to solve. So while an app that calculates and charges everyone instantly is a 100% solution of this problem, sure this is a problem a lot of people listening have come up with. I've come up with it myself. It's not strong. It's not that important. And when it's not that important, the probability that people are going to pay you is very low. Now you might be listening to this reading what I have here on the page and you might say, well, you know, buddy, I've got plenty of examples of apps that solve relatively minor problems that are very successful to which I would say that certainly that is the case. But it's generally more so an exception than it is the rule. It's pretty rare that you have an app category that is able to actually contribute to solving a major problem that a lot of people experience and is able to contribute to a large proportion of those people were the entire app category flops. So as with everything, there are always exceptions both with respect to minor problem, 100% solutions that succeed in major problem 10% solutions that fail. But this is a great overarching principle to abide by. When you're coming up with your ideas, refer back to the case studies, refer back to these principles. Is it solving a major problem that a lot of people experience even if in a minor way? If you go to a bunch of your friends and you share with them your idea and the overwhelming reaction is like, oh, well, I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah, that's a good idea. No, yeah, you should definitely do that. They're probably just being supportive. They probably think that it's a fucking bad idea. So the good ideas are always abundantly obvious. Okay. Now building off of this final thought here, make people feel, don't make them think in line with that. When you tell someone your idea, they should be able to feel it because when people see an advertisement for your product, they don't have enough time to go through. Deep, rigorous analysis of why that problem that you're solving is going to be important to them and why it's going to improve their life. No, they need to feel that, right? Our subconscious process is more quickly than our conscious does. This is what leads to a scrolling past a video versus seeing it and immediately downloading the product and paying for it thereafter. Okay, so identify the fundamental human drive that the problem you're solving relates to. This is why we have this column here. All right, we're solving dating or solving health, discipline, spirituality, success, social validation, right? We're not abstracting out these terms too much when we're listening them here. We're keeping it very, very simple, very straightforward. Okay, identify the fundamental human drive, build as close to it as possible. You could abstract out this, splitting a dinner bill evenly. You could say, well, this actually helps with reproduction because if you save a little bit of money and there's increased fairness in the world, then you are going to be able to position yourself as a higher status person or you save cash or maybe the friend group likes you more because you come up with these creative solutions and therefore everyone wants to be the person that introduces this product to the friend group because you'll get social credit for that. Thereby it enables you to get more action way too much, way too much. Build a close to it. Build a close, simple. Finally, don't fear starting small on a big problem when we were building RISGPT, when we built UMax, Kelly, people often said that they were very small advances for RISGPT. It's like, well, who's actually going to pay to have an AI respond to them? The answer is a lot of people. For UMax, it's like, dude, to get a rating of how attractive I am, I don't fucking need that. That doesn't actually help me become more attractive. A lot of people still like that product. A lot of people think that it's going to help them advance, which it does. It provides recommendations on how to improve. You might say, well, I can just look at myself in the mirror and I understand, but not everybody does. Finally, Cal AI, everyone's like, well, AI calorie tracking, the current calorie tracker has already worked. It can't be that accurate. The current calorie trackers have a lot of friction and minor increases, I would say even like 2x increase in speed to track the calories results in people across the board being able to achieve their fitness goals, a much higher degree of probability of success, right? Even though there may be slight decreases in accuracy, it will enable people that previously struggled with the consistency of calorie tracking to be able to lose weight or gain weight, which are of paramount importance in humans lives. Okay. That is pretty much it on human psychology. These are simple truths, but there are truths nonetheless that I think are not adequately represented. The importance of the biological imperative, building close to the major problems that people experience rather than over intellectualized abstractions, solving these massive problems even in a minor way, and then making sure that people can feel it without having to think about it. Okay. Next up, you have an assignment to apply some of the principles and ideas that we spoke about in this lesson and the previous. In the analysis of the case studies listed in the first lesson, in the next unit, we are going to go over actually identifying the very specific problems in your life as well as on social media. So stay tuned for that. If you have any questions on the assignment, figure it out. I believe in you. Peace out.

### Transcript

Lesson 4 or lesson 1.1.0, this is module 1 unit 1 lesson 0. Solve your own problems. Okay, this unit will be about solving problems. This is actual tangible problem identification, not to be confused with the previous unit which was an introduction. Going over case studies, the trade-offs of idea versus execution and the underpinnings of human psychology, right? This is all to line up for this being the sort of main unit of this module 1 that is ideation. After this we'll go over sort of deeper analysis. Once you've got to have an idea, going into seeing how much other apps in the category make, scrolling the app store. But for now, let's talk about solving problems. Okay, so previously I stated that the closer you are or your product is to the biological imperative, the more likely you are to succeed. Now the closer your product is to your own problems, so the problems that you experience, the more likely you are to succeed. Now this should be intuitive, this should be obvious. When you build for other people, you do not fully understand the pain points. You have been experienced them yourself. The more empathetic and emotionally intelligent you are, the more you can make up for this. But there is no better observer than the individual that experiences the problem. You rely on second hand feedback, which is incomplete or misleading. So if you try to practice empathy or speak to people that experience the problem, you are just one level of abstraction away from experiencing the problem itself. Now this is very key for founders to understand. Most people are very, very poor at articulating their problems. And in fact, have actually no idea what the serious or biggest problems that they experience in their life are. Now, sometimes they subconsciously or almost always subconsciously know, but make consciously articulate as being something else. This is also an issue with user feedback, which I'll get into later. So speaking to others is helpful, but it's best to solve your own problems. Finally, you'll lack the emotional urgency necessary to push through the hard moments. In the journey of building any product, there will be difficult moments where it's easier to take the path of least resistance and give up and move on to something else. Now when you care about the problem, it will make it easier to push through and continue working on it. I mentioned earlier that it's okay to build for money. Do you want to build a product because it's going to make cash and at the end of the day you want cash? That can simultaneously be true while it also being the case that it's better to build around things that you care about. So if you do care about money, figure out how to build something that makes money and solves something that you care about. Now a very, very, very important caveat is that an individual only experiences so many problems. So the next best option is to solve the problems that are experienced by your close friends or family. Okay, let's get tangible. When I was building a Holly, the College of Marketplace app, the problem that I identified was that girls specifically were buying and selling clothing in groupmeas on college campuses. Now I had some friends that experienced this as well. And so the first thing that I did was I spoke to my friends, both guys and girls and just other girls that I knew were very active in these groupmeas to hear about the problems that they experienced. I thought that I was doing the right thing. I was like, okay, this is how you solve problems. Now there were a lot of other factors that made it difficult. But one thing that we kept running into was I was constantly trying to put myself in the shoes of a girl who wants to figure out what's going to look best for her date nights and sorority parties and whatnot. But that's not who I am. And I've actually never really cared about clothing to begin with. Now as we're working on it, senior year is coming to an end. This is the spring. I'm like, man, I kind of see right, it was on the wall. It's not going to work. So I started thinking about other things that I want to solve. And at this time, I actually began working on a few different projects. One that I started working on was a sort of science-based hypertrophy maximization software. I actually know the founders of many of the most popular ones like Fitness AI and whatnot on the market. And the algorithms that the ML, they're essentially solver algorithms that they use are pretty rudimentary as well as they don't account for some of the more complex variables with regards to maximizing hypertrophy. Not to get too granular, but just to give an example. The way that a lot of these software's work is we have some threshold that we look to hit on weekly volume for the number of sets targeting chest. OK. So exercise like bench, they might call that one set for chest stimulus. The issue with that is a compound exercise like bench also works your triceps and your shoulders or front delts. But it also occurs significantly more fatigue. So when you say that a set of benches, one set for chest and a set of tricep extensions is one set for triceps, that is an over-massive oversimplification with regards to comprehensive total fatigue accumulated as well as relative hypertrophic stimulus across different muscle groups. So that was one thing that I was working on. So that was a problem that I intimately experienced myself wanting to know what I can do in the gym to make sure that I'm maximizing my gains. Now a problem that people very close to me experienced was what to say on daily apps. I experienced it myself too, right? The point here isn't that I don't know how to talk to girls, but that sometimes you receive a message and you're like, hmm, what's the proper amount of flirtyness versus straight forwardness to respond to maximize my probability of developing a connection with this girl? That's some people's objective. Other people's objective is how to have sex with her, right? We can call this spade a spade. Different people have different objectives. So given that chat GPT had just come out, we were like, this can easily be solved. So we built an app where you can upload the screenshot, slide the spiciness, essentially according to whether or not you want to be a little bit more tame or more straightforward with your response. Now given our deep knowledge, so I want to say our, I mean me, my co-founders, given our deep knowledge of this topic, we were able to figure out the proper user experience. So what features actually matter to guys that are trying to figure out what to say to girls on dating apps, as well as what the correct distribution channels are going to be because we had seen that content ourselves. So once again, the closer that you are to the problem, the easier that it will be to solve. Now if you're not solving for yourself, try to solve your friends, your family, or people very close to your demographic. Okay, as I mentioned earlier, speaking to users. So this is touching a little bit on the future, but this is very important note. As you scale, user feedback will be able to inform your product direction, but early on, it's more likely to cloud your judgment. The world is a deeply inefficient place. I think that humans are deeply inefficient and unintelligent relative to the intelligence of the collective. But when you venture off to try to solve a problem on your own, most advice is going to be noise. If we think about this from a machine learning perspective, signal versus noise, the reason that the vast majority of entrepreneurs are not successful, or one of the key reasons in my opinion, is the inability to distinguish signal from noise. The act of coming up with a good idea, especially one that's novel and presents significant upside, is very, very, very difficult. And you can't outsource that. So you can speak to people and get their opinions, and you can use that as overall data. But don't expect others to do the work for you. Just because someone tells you that they want something in your product doesn't mean that that's the right move. Those are the reason that Steve Jobs and Elon Musk do not go to daily focus groups. They're artists. They're more than artists, they're businessmen. But being an artist is a component of building an amazing product. So do not over index on others' opinions, think freely, and from first principles. So we have these overarching ideas about the fact that you should solve your own problem. How do you actually identify them? Short answer is there is no magic trick, but there are general frameworks that I and others apply that tend to work. The creative act, a way of being, is an amazing book. It's by Rick Rubin, who works with music artists. He provides a lot of great frameworks here, so I would recommend that. But personally, even before Rick Rubin or before I had read his book, I've spoken deeply or extensively about this, which is that I'm a massive believer in disconnection. Go for a walk, run, hike, meditate, do whatever you want. Do it for extended periods for over an hour. I find that if I go on a ten minute walk, my mind's still super cluttered from everything that we experience in day to day life. If you really want to come up with good new ideas, you need to give your mind room to breathe. The same way that if you go and you start, you haven't played basketball in a while. You go start to shoot the first few minutes, you're rusty. You've got to work those muscles and build back the sort of mind muscle connection and your body's muscle memory into remembering how to properly shoot with finesse in a smooth manner. I think that the same applies to disconnection giving your mind space to breathe. Within the book, he has a great concept, which is that if you want to come up with truly novel ideas, they don't come from within, but they come from the out, from external. They come from the universe. You need to make yourself into somewhat of an antenna, an individual that will receive the ideas that permeate our universe. Different people are going to be operating on different sort of wavelengths, different frequencies. So, given your demographic and what sort of group you belong to and who you are, you will be more receptive and have a higher probability of receiving some different subset of ideas. There's a reason that my apps are all kind of in the same domain. RizGPT, Talk to Girls, UMACS, Scan Your Face, Find out how attractive you are. Kaliai, Achieve your fitness goals, become more attractive, right? This is something that I think I have pretty deep knowledge on, personal development, self improvement, right? Even Tenex, which I didn't actually mention during this, it was recently failed project of mine, but Tenex was designed to teach people how to learn different AI tools. Once again, within the domain of self improvement, this is something that I very, very deeply understand. If you're a very religious individual, you might be more inclined to build something like Bible chat, right? I consider myself religious, Christian, Presbyterian specifically. But I don't think that I have domain expertise significantly beyond that of the average Christian. If you are a very studious individual, right, I didn't list this company here, but it's similar to Minnet AI, Turbo, TurboLearn, company that I am an advisor of actually. I pretty much never advised. They're like one of the only ones specifically because Sarthic, one of the co-founders, was my CTO for UMACS. Now Sarthic and Rudy were very, very diligent studiers and test takers. Sarthic got a 36 on his ACT and had a 40, I think he was valedictorian of high school. So, note taking specifically for education, high school college is a domain that they very, very deeply understand. Hunter had been interested in social products for years before building NGL. You know, the quitter guys, right? Conor and Alex were deeply, deeply addicted to pornography. I'm sorry, that's a joke. That's a joke. They're more so in the like your friends, right? People of our demographic, they're young guys. You guys are taking the point. Oh, I don't even think I mentioned raised during the case study. I can't believe I missed that. Anyways, raised, built by Anastasia and Tamera Tran. Raze is actually no longer on the App Store. So here I have a copycat from them. They got banned. But raised, this was, you know, not coincidentally built by girls who understand how important tanning is to other girls. That's an idea that guys would never come up with. Me building UMACs, like most other software engineers are not going to see looks maxing at its absolute peak and also understand the vision API coming out and being in the correct position to solve that problem. So you should ask yourself, what are the problems that you intimately understand? What are the problems that you understand that other people don't understand? What are the problems that you care about? You care about self improvement. Do you care about career? Do you care about religion and spirituality? Do you care about meditation? If you have listened to what I've said throughout this unit thus far, you go, well, I still don't, you know, I still don't have any ideas. My suggestion would be to become a more interesting person. If you don't have things that you care about, if you look through life in a very monotonous, black and white lens, you're not going to be the person that ideas come to. So study the fundamentals of human psychology. What your expectations are for the projects that you build, figure out what your problems are and the things that you care about and then use that in conjunction with disconnection, right? Remove all of the other noise that exists within your life. Take what I just repeated. These principles that I've taught up to this point go for a long walk. Connect, remove everything, keep that and let it ruminate. I have no doubt that so long as you are an interesting person that experiences anything of any relative importance in life that you will begin to come up with new ideas. And beyond the disconnection, I want you to hold this in the back of your mind and it should begin to impact everything that you do, like every place that you go, every interaction that you have, you should be thinking in any entrepreneur to be honest, beyond just building up should be thinking about this. But I want you to look at it through the lens of like, what are the problems that these people experience in life and is there an app that can help them solve that and help them inch forward? Okay. In the next lesson, I will dive into social media and forums. So here I talk about kind of diving inside, receiving from the universe, disconnecting. But now we're going to go through social media and the idea of actually stimulation and new data. So as opposed to removing everything else out, we're going to talk about what's the stuff that we should bring in. And how do we go through Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, X.com and other forums to identify problems that people experience and have actually made obvious for us on the internet. So I'll see you in the next lesson.

### Transcript

Welcome back. I believe this is lesson five that we're on now. And today we're going to be doing an interactive lesson. Okay. So we're going to be scrolling Instagram and TikTok to come up with ideas. So if you remember at the end of the... Wait, let me fix this. Track me, boy. Here we go. Okay. If you remember at the end of the previous lesson, we're going over how to identify and the importance of solving your own problems. I spoke about the value of disconnection, right? Going for a walk, going for a run, going for a hike, meditation, whatever it may be, for extended periods of time. So this is de-stimulation, which I think is very important. I think people don't spend enough time nowadays. I wanted to start with that because it's so important. But stimulation is also valuable. And this is a cool practice because you'll be able to carry it into your current daily scrolling. And if you don't scroll on a daily basis right now, I would actually recommend that you create new accounts and begin scrolling on Instagram Reels and TikTok. The reason that I suggest this, particularly to start over Reddit and Twitter, is because this is where the majority of consumers live. This is where the collective unconscious lives. The collective unconscious is largely a Jungian concept. But it essentially posits that throughout society, so for us, the Western world, the United States, we all operate with this collective unconscious underpinning that informs a lot of our action as well as our sort of psychological interests. Okay, so for this lesson, I'm going to begin scrolling on Instagram and TikTok and giving my opinion on different videos, pretty unfiltered. Here I've got a few notes that I'll touch on really quickly before I start. So first off, scrolling the Explorer page. This is Explorer. This is for you page. Now you can also intentionally search up different sort of key terms, looks maxing, Riz, weightlifting, you know, calorie counting, tanning, class action lawsuits, right? All these different domains that people build absent. As you find different niches, you should follow down rabbit holes. You'll be able to begin to recognize these connected webs that exist on the internet, which are essentially niches. I think the cookie verse is a great example. If you don't know what the cookie verse is, you are not chronically online enough. The cookie verse is essentially an offshoot of the looks maxing universe that is centered around cookie king, who is a content creator. He has a very, you know, he has this like, this affect to him. That is very charismatic and endearing. And he operates within the looks maxing niche, but his whole thing is almost like anti-looks maxing where he's eating terrible food. Anyways, I won't dive too deep, but key takeaway here, there are a lot of different niches, rabbit holes, and universes that you can find on the internet. You should ask yourself what is binding these different groups. So for looks maxing, it's the desire to become more attractive. For weightlifting, it is the desire to get stronger. For female relationship advice, it is the desire to find a compatible romantic partner. You can create new accounts as I mentioned to hit these demographics. So I've created accounts trying to put myself in the mind of a 30 year old woman and engaging with content that she would like in order to see a side of the internet that I've never seen before. Now, I know previously I spoke about the importance of solving problems close to you. And yes, that is great. And I think a very valuable framework for most individuals. But the majority of people that are taking this course and the majority of young, or I should say entrepreneurial app developers as a whole, are somewhere around the age of like 15 to 35 year old men. And so for example, the needs and desires of 70 year old women are being completely neglected. Now this is the value of creating new accounts to hit these demographics. If you are somebody who has a very deep understanding of human psychology and you think that you can traverse those different demographics, there is often a lot of alpha or upside in doing so. Now finally, we're going to get a lot more into this in the Reddit and Instagram section. But in short, see what people are manually solving. What are people asking for in the comment sections? The comment sections are like the most underrated place to really learn about the wants, needs, and thoughts of different types of people. The way that I came up with the idea of UMACS was consuming looks, maxing content and seeing these content creators do manual reviews, which people were paying for to get reviews of themselves by these content creators. People are paying 50, 100 plus dollars to get a review of how attractive they are and how they can become more attractive. And now this became abundantly obvious to me. All right, people are already paying for this, but AI can do it as soon as the vision EPI is released through open AI. So these are just some cool little things to think about, as well as a bunch of others that I will get into. Enough of that. Let's do it. All right, I hope that there's nothing bad on my feed. Okay, so I just pulled up Instagram, we'll refresh the Explorer page. See what's going on up in here. I hear we got Colin Myers, cool guy. When I was like 14, 15, it was like a religion to an only rib linker. Me and my friend, we would go through cards in like three, three days spam and that shit. So I think there's going to be an echo. So when I'm playing this, I'm going to turn down my mic audio. Yeah, I'm going to turn down my mic audio and then I'll just kind of swap, I guess, an alternate. Is there a better way to do this? Hmm. All right, I'm going to stitch this once I figure it out.

All right, all right, I think, wait, test, test. Yeah, okay. I think that I've got it working. What I'm gonna do here is I turn off the screen record audio. So you guys are just gonna listen to it through my mic. All right, let's get going. I wonder if it didn't eat damage, but it's hard to tell because it's just like who I ended up being, so like you don't really know if there's damage. I always think about that as well. I feel like smoking a lot of Zaza, and honestly makes you smarter over the long term. Because you always come to some crossroads. I think you made a video while back, talking about like when you quit for a little bit, that period when you stopped, you probably like had some sort of enlightenment. When you quit, you get like a new high. You haven't been sober and so on and it feels like you're higher. And that's why I started using the quitting weed app. So that would be an example of a place where content about smoking too much weed is very popular. And so I'm sure that they're quitting weed apps that already exist, but like anytime I watch a piece of content like that, I'm like, what's the hook at the very end? Where you plug it in some piece of software. Callin' actually very cool, and then Daddy well in this guy interviewing him. I'm going on his podcast in a few days. All right, let's keep going and take a look at this. Oh. Oh. You know, there you could probably like, when I look at that, I'm like, I'm thinking like, okay, in the bio. So this is from a creator who like he probably sells his own course or whatever, but this sort of content often does well. I'm like, okay, in the bio there, you could have some sort of call to action of like, so I know Sebastian George who runs this, this can, I guess somewhat consumer, somewhat B2B app, where you can create automatic Shopify templates, right? This is promoting e-commerce. You have in the caption, like go download or integrate this Chrome extension or whatever sort of form factor that app takes. You could easily integrate that right here. Summer 25 batch. Yeah. Hackney pimples dry skin red spots. We've all dealt with some version of it. And most of the topologists are going to give you a topical fix. Well, it does help treat the issue. It doesn't actually solve it. Trust me, I know with all my skincare videos. And reality, the core problem lies in your diet. And that's why I'm watching the new software called, I'm going to do a lot of work on it. I'm going to do a lot of work on it. And that's why I'm watching the new software called Be Clear. Right now, we're in formula testing. And I wonder if before I walk it in, do you guys prefer a powder where you can mix a drink or a daily pill? And would you want to just target breakouts or also focus on dryness, retinus and overall glow? I can always include skin supporting at the auctions, like vitamin C, zinc for healing them. So this is part of the looks, maxing niche, talking about skincare. I think there's actually an app that's been doing pretty well recently called Proofit where you can scan supplements and see how high quality they are. And so this is obviously, this is from KShami, a Senn Laboratories, his new brand doing supplements. But here I would probably, like this content obviously does well and traditionally has been doing well for a while, which content in the looks, maxing niche, get better skin, whatever. So something in the range of like, maybe a cross between like a Calai X sort of Proofit slash Yuka supplement, or excuse me, Yuka food scanner, where you have an application where you take a picture of food specifically designed for people with bad skin, or even like looks, maxing, right? Where you scan supplements, scan the food that you're eating and then get exercise recommendations to help you become more attractive. Let's keep going. So trading apps are becoming somewhat popular, sort of like chart analysis and whatnot. So any sort of account, anytime I see an account like this, if you're looking for an idea, you can find the sort of niche, which is like trading slash fintech advice and then work backwards. And you're like, okay, what are the problems that these people face? So you could pretty easily be like, so you could pretty easily build a product that provides like history and context on different coins, stocks, whatever it may be before you trade and actually purchase. Now I don't know whether or not you would need to offer trading for that product to work as well, but just an idea. As you can see my contents very, very much so like, you know, bro, fitness, entrepreneur, you know, as you earn money by rating AI responses, and it's all thanks to a tool that gives you free access to the 500 of the world's best AI models that actually pays you to use them. It's called a Yop AI, and let's you compare results from all like ChatGPT and Claude and Gemini, all in one place. You just give it a prompt and when you compare and rate the different AI responses, you get credits that can be written for actual real cash. And so not only is it completely free, but you also get used to on damn models like Brock and Gemini at the same time. Well, earning up to 50 bucks a month just for getting your feedback. Wanna try it for yourself? Just comment the up and I'll say to you. This is interesting. I mean, another example of a very quickly rising industry to build around. We go back to this sort of like course case studies success. Like AI, from what I've seen, the AI tools that do best are, or rather I should say they like learn to use AI style tools that do best are ones that are in the mix of sort of career progression slash education. Now this one, this guy is a great example of a creator that you can kind of build around. So I think that that's pretty interesting. Let's see that. This is the best fucking time ever starting company. But part of the reason that's the best is because the ground is shaking and it's true. There are a lot. All right, this messaging, another good framework here, finding messaging that is becoming increasingly popular on social media and then work backwards from there to like what's the idea that you build around it. Or what's the product that you build around that. So this was one of my plans with 10x. Unfortunately, I just don't think 10x had the correct product UX, as well as there were other sort of a few extraneous variables that made that company hard to scale. But you can see that anything about sort of like AI tools gets people up in arms. This person commented, misused AI skills are dangerous for humanity. This person is talking about, he's talking about how the AI tools are good for himself. Don't worry, there's nothing left for us to do. So fear mongering within the AI niche, like AI is going to take your job, figure out how to build a tool to prevent that from happening. Or to help the person take other people's jobs, as Ethan, right? That's like these N8N agents, which are like create these workflow automations to kind of outsource and displace traditional human labor. Okay, I've got an idea actually. I think I've mentioned this idea in the past. Nobody has really executed on it. Gotta blur that, you guys can't see what I'm looking at. Okay, this guy has been ripping recently. A good sign that a creator is doing really well, as well as they are operating within an up and coming space, becoming increasingly popular, is when they have, and they generate a lot of views relative to their followers. 60,000 followers on Instagram, doing a couple hundred thousand views of video is extremely impressive. Now, this guy and Draugianic, I think that's it, Andrew Genic. One of those two. He talks about steroids. Okay, so let's watch one of these videos. I can't volume. What the fuck? Let me make this a little bit smaller real quick so I can turn on volume. Tagging the stick, play on repeat. This term is used to disrupt a gene that is advantageous here, and the left is disadvantageous in lay life. All vice versa. How this relates to being natural or enhanced is that most gene variants, early provided vantage, either early or late in life, or not both. For example, longevity genes, such as the Fox 3, so one, overdue. Okay. I'm not gonna spend too much time watching this, but I'll give you guys the background on this rising industry. It's funny, I somewhat experienced this myself in seeing it firsthand in high school about half of my friends took steroids. Now, what are the big macro factors at play here? Melta Stoshrone is rapidly decreasing or has been rapidly decreasing over the past century, due to things like microplastics, low food quality, contaminated water, amongst other things. Now, a high proportion of people are pushing back against this by taking steroids. Another sort of tailwind here is people more than ever want to be and feel, I should say, has more than ever want to be and do feel masculine. So how do we build a product around this? Well, one, there's a lot of opportunity, I think, for building a product that helps people take steroids and provides advice to help them do it more safely. I personally don't want to be on the end of pushing and making steroids more accessible. I would not encourage that individuals build that, but there is opportunity there. Now, I see one of these niches. This is kind of what I did with the looks, Maxing. I'm like, okay, this is the tailwind. How do we build a product around this that pushes people in a positive direction? So I think that there's massive opportunity to build a product that helps people naturally maximize their testosterone. You have them input what they are currently doing, exercise, nutrition, sleep, whatever it may be. And then you develop a custom routine as well as habit tracking for them, do help them increase their testosterone. I would do this somewhat in the range of like UMAX, slash these daily habit trackers, slash like maybe like the inverse of quitter where you have like, it's all about your sort of like streak where quitter is all about like staying away from pouring, this could be all about, I guess this is just what habit trackers are, but keeping your streak of engaging in these testosterone optimization practices. Now even beyond that, I think there's a lot of opportunity to build a holistic health optimizer. So as you can see, like when I go through reels, it's not overly structured. I'm just going through using this to get my creative juices flowing. And even like with that guy Androgynick, I had seen that he was garnering a really cult, like, or I shouldn't say massive, but a very strong cult, like following on social media. And then I kind of start to work backwards, right? You identify the things that people are interested in and then you can kind of work backwards and figure out, okay, what they're interested in this because they have this subset of problems. Now how can I solve that inside of consumer application? All right, that's be good for Instagram. Let's move on over to TikTok. That as soon as the bar slows down, one or two minutes later, it falls on. Yeah, it was surprising. I'll be like, look, it's the easiest way to work. And the moment I struggle is that because you have a high proportion of fast, which mostly fibers only average person is why you could be a leader of the NFL. It means that your fibers create a fit. All right, this is TNF head of, I say head, essentially the leader of hypertrophy maximization TikTok. Building more muscle, right? He is the key opinion leader, very intelligent guy. If you go back to, I think it was my, I don't know, I was fucking one of these earlier lessons. I spoke about the idea that I had and started to build about a workout optimization application. I think that there is massive opportunity there. Nobody's got it right. If you deeply understand weightlifting and hypertrophy maximization, and you can actually develop, and you also have to have relatively extensive ML knowledge here, you can build an extremely effective recommendation product. Chat GPT will absolutely not suffice, but AI models could help with the data labeling side of things, which is non-trivial for something like this. By the way, by data labeling, I'm referring to, essentially like the values that you assign to the different variables that correspond to each individual lift. So for bench, I might assign 1.0 hypertrophic stimulus to my chest and maybe 0.5 to my front delts and 0.5 to my triceps, and then the overall fatigue load out of 10 might be an eight. All right, maybe seven. Whereas squat, right? It's going to be largely quads, glutes, and some hamstrings, and then fatigue load might be nine or 10. And then tricep extension, tricep stimulus would be a 1.0, and then one out of one, and then the fatigue stimulus would be somewhere in the range of like a four, three, whatever. So, okay, onward. Now based off of the sheer amount of people we're talking to, watch it. Another killer idea, Nick Fuentes, absolutely fucking ripping right now, he's taking over, I mean, honestly, like short form, like political right content, whatever. On the flip side, you've got guys like, like, Dean withers maybe, Harry fucking something, Sisson. I don't know anyone that's built a popular single player, AI politics app, massive opportunity there, right? I briefly built a software that I never, I just built like the back end skeleton where I scraped the RSS feeds of all the popular news websites, and I would generate unbiased reports based on the most controversial popular stories. Now you can build an AI app that does something like that, feeds people, you know, you'd have to do it in a legal way. I don't think that was actually, it would not have been legal if I commercialized that. So, do your own legal research. But then maybe you have that, and you have like a different personality, political test, that sort of thing. And then the amount of people who told me, oh, hi there, why didn't Jared help? And I'm the guy, everything, I've got knowledge. I'm not a lot of us. I don't, yeah, I don't really know what's going on here. I don't know why there are women on my 4U page. There's my therapist help me, Raleigh. I think it's more nature than people would like to, no matter how rich I get, there's one thing I will, share with Jimmy, that's my boy. There's just basically a super-digit trick. There's individual of us, Dad. I don't think that's a big deal. Alex, you bang, we love Alex, Alex is a Callie-I influencer. I like you go every Sunday. Okay, so you're like, oh man, get that bill and some. I don't know why there's all this Nick Fuentes on my 4U page. I love Jewish people. If anyone is gonna get mad about that, I do think Nick is an interesting guy, and I like listening to him. Nah, I touched that. Damn. Honey, why don't we just go get some funnel cakes? No funnel cakes, bear. Nah, I touched that cake. What are these little things? You don't have to be the dad got a job with it. It's not the shower, it's not the shower, it's not the party shower, it's not. Yes, you are. Look at the big guy. You're out in the fire. Hey guys, this is really easy. Where's he coming from? Here's where, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's good enough. This ceiling's gone. Diabolical things, I wanted a man. Number one, height. My man's gotta be above 62. My last two boyfriends were 63. Both of them. And they were jacked, and they looked really good. How am I supposed to downgrade from that? So unfortunately, my next man will have to be 62. And now, number two, you can't have a bet. I need you build. All right. All right. You ready? Number two, I need you to be fit. Boba, Boba, Boba, Boba. Number three. Number three, he needs to be emotionally intelligent. My friend literally just sent me this app where you can actually do like emotional intelligence tests with your boyfriend without them even realizing that it's an emotional intelligence test. And then then then then. But you see, that's a good fucking hook. Find the content, figure out how to build the product around it. This shit always rips. Girls just fucking. Man, man, man, man, man. I love girls. They'll get me wrong. But find girl content. Man, man, man, man, man. And then insert the product in number three. I'm sure they'll speak about this in distribution. But there are like hard strong hooks where you want to hit first couple seconds of the video. And then there are more natural hooks where you draw the person in. And they don't even realize what's going on. It's a fish. You cast the line. Fucking fish gets the worm. He's like, oh shit. I'm chillin. I'm eating good. And he starts pulling me. He's like, wait, what's going on here? It doesn't really know what the fuck's up. And then you fucking hook him. You know, right? That's what you do in these videos. You get him going. And then you integrate the promo. So that's one style. Did you fit and go into the gym multiple times a week? I'm sorry. I'm just not going to need a factor. If I have a salary cap to make corporate, what is your 100K salary for no we're good? I need you in a career that is. I'm just still watching this because I want to see if there's a plug. I am a lover of luxury. I like expensive things. I like expensive vacation. So you, if you're my man, so we need a career that can support that. Number four, whenever we travel, he's got to be fine as business. The other, I get salary. She's not really impressed when I hear something really big or a protectant. I get it. There's no product on there. I don't know why they're girls shaking ass on my 4U page. We don't watch that. We're bad that we can't reach $22,000. Oh. Welcome to the world. Yes, I, I, if the real reason for the current state of black communities is stop buying corn. I don't know. Do you think you look older than 19? Yes. Yeah, anything testosterone. This is clavicular friends with the guy that I mentioned earlier, and Draganic, and Santa Cruz medicinal. Santa Cruz and I used to be friends. He's mad at me now, because I think that he thinks I was talking shit. I wasn't, but you know, it's all right. Anyways, clavicular is also part of the whole Androganic like a teenage testosterone optimization movement. Once again, I'm not a fan of, or he does steroids, specifically, and pushes steroids to teenagers. I don't fuck with pushing steroids to people, but what I do fuck with is helping people get healthier. So he would be another good guy to consume his content if you want to understand this sort of like new wave. You know, this, it's almost like an offshoot of looks maxing into hormone optimization. Don't know if you'll play role-native. Don't stop, yeah, get it. Shake, shake, shake. I got slushing about that. This is a fire fucking ad. I got slushed into vicar. It's a shame. I really do. You're basketball. From the moment I started rolling my dick. Yo, there they are together. The two guys that I mentioned, Avicular and Androganic. That's hilarious. There are my single day, you're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. If you are thinking of working with that fine. Zinn. And. I distracted apparently the Ironman World Championship is 33 days away. Endurance training application. In my understanding, most of these apps are like individual right now or fragmented. So you got like a Strava obviously for planning your runs. Whereas, you know, Runa helps you with run training plans. I'm uncertain of the state of this, but I currently use chat GPT to plan my Ironman training. Honestly, we'll see if I have enough time to actually put towards it. It's in about three months now. But Luke Hoplife, awesome dude. Ironman training hybrid athlete, influencer guy. A lot of opportunity to build a hybrid training application and market it with guys like him. Clean your it. All right, that's crazy. I think I've told you guys before that sometimes you get emergence capabilities in most English models. It's one of their signature things. Translation was an emerging capability in most language models. You get a true how they could trust you. Emergence is like one of the most interesting concepts. They just were certain scale and they had enough language data and they just could do it very, very, very well. Now we have a new emotional capability. This is an images and movies, veil three, VEO three. What up, Posey? Can't take. Yeah, that's a lot. It's like that you draw on a total of two. You can use mine later. I'm filming by the way. Say hi. What up, boys? Let's give it in. All right, I don't, this guy's too fucking boring. But like AI creators, always interesting dudes to work with. Door competitor. All right, all right, all right. Fuck it, let me on that. Edmond some hot girl doing some shit. Okay. That's probably enough of me scrolling. I'd encourage, and I think that there will be an assignment about this. Scroll through, come up with ideas as you scroll. For me, it's obviously like my for you page and the ideas that I think of are very confined within the realm of self improvement. Right, this is just me. This is who I am. Sure, every individual watching this has different things that they deeply understand and deeply care about. For some of y'all, it might be teaching people how to code and making a new wave AI coding tutor that you can use on your phone in your free time for teenagers. For other people, it might be, it might be female mental health. I don't know what things that you care about are, things that you have particular interest in, but you social media to identify the content that is already doing well. And then once you have your idea, which I didn't do here, but if you have a specific idea in mind, then cure it your entire for you page around that if it is not already curated around it. This is very, very, very, very important. As you come to the conclusion of your idea, if you're a for you page is not already all that content, it should consume your entire for you page. Right now, you see, like, I have a little bit of a random looks, maxing stuff here and there because that was a big part of my life in the past. But when I was building UMACS, every single fucking video, every single one was looks, maxing content. When I was building RizGPT, every single piece of content was RizGPT, when I was building Cal AI at the in the early days, every single piece of content was calorie tracking content. So either cure it your current for you pages to hit it or create new accounts to build around it. All right, that's enough for this lesson. In the next lesson, we will go over Reddit and X.com.

### Transcript

Alright, we're back. Got a little black eye from this weekend. I low-key probably need stitches but I feel like you know, face cuts are kind of cool so might let it ride. Anyways today we're taking a look at Reddit and x.com. Personally I use Instagram and TikTok as my primary source of social media scanning but it's worth touching on the value that Reddit, X and other text slash forum style websites provide. Good framework I use is Instagram and TikTok is a better representation of the general zeitgeist or sort of collective unconscious. The things that manifest themselves there through content sort of ideas and things that people are interested in are generally more mass market whereas on Reddit and x.com it is easier and you are more likely to sort of fall into and you're able to analyze these high intent cult like rabbit holes which are actually extremely important in their own respect. So I'll start off here with a material example. Okay during the last video I spoke a little bit about looks maxing but let's let's go into this Reddit channel. Okay this is obviously a joke but I don't know why it's all women right now. It looks like it's just thirst traps. This is not how it used to be. When I first built UMax it was filled with people like this pretty normal looking dudes asking for advice on how to improve their facial aesthetics. I would bet that part of it here is like the pictures of girls are just more likely to get up votes. But you know let's see this. Okay so we used to actually I used to sponsor so if you go back to looks maxing advice from years ago every single post had a try UMax. I guess someone else probably outbid us recently and not really put any operational effort into UMax anymore. But anyways enough general background what's the key takeaway here. There are a ton of people on the internet that are asking for advice on how to improve their facial aesthetics. They want ratings as well as advice. So I had first seen this on TikTok. I found forums like R-slash looks maxing advice as well as the looks maxing forum. So I think we can find this looks maxing. There's like a dedicated looks maxing forum too. This might be it. Another good example of this is bodybuilding. Oh it may have been deleted. Yeah this used to be a really popular one the forums on bodybuilding.com. Anyways you can go to these forums and you can see what people are asking for. Then the next step there is do your market research which we'll talk about in the next video. And if the products that are solving these problems don't already exist that's a great signal that you can build them and then use these communities as your initial method of penetration and generating distribution traffic awareness that sort of thing. What you'll often find is that the sort of niches and content that people are interested in on short form. So TikTok and Instagram will also have companion forums on Reddit and X as we'll later look into. So if we go to nofap Hmm. I know that there used to be a popular um maybe oh here. Why is it hidden? That's so weird. Okay well there is a Reddit forum of nofap which has 1.2 million members. Um is this quitter? Maybe this is a different application. Anyways when Alex and Connor were building quitter they saw this sort of organic movement on on these different forum websites as well as short form social media. And if you go here and you read these these posts what you'll find is you'll be able to very easily put yourself into the mind of people who are trying to you know achieve these different results. For looks-maxim they want to find out how attractive they are and how they can become more attractive. For nofap they want to figure out how to develop the discipline to be able to overcome their addiction to pornography and masturbation. So these these Reddit forums are an absolute gold mine for for figuring out what the wants and desires are of the really high intent users. So you can identify these either large or quickly growing communities so nofap has been large for a while. On the other end for UMACs um you know looks-maxim was was very high growth at that point. You identify the problems that these people are experiencing and then what are the solutions that they're directly or indirectly asking for. Okay now we can move over to X. Okay so I started here on politics because as I mentioned yesterday this sort of like anti-deep state America first movement is growing very quickly one idea for a product. Um this might be a slightly one of these like study over intellectualized products but would probably go viral nevertheless would be a product where you can input any individuals name and see who they're deeply connected to who they have ties to who they've received funding from um and and essentially identify what the individuals background biases are. Um so politics obviously always super viral there's still very few apps built in that domain so could could be interesting. Um okay I'm gonna keep scrolling a little bit. Um crypto crypto as well as financial X is always very large building strategic tooling for individuals to to source higher quality information could be very interesting. For example I know that these these deep research AI models are very effective at um you know quickly and exhaustively scraping the internet for for different for for news and information on different topics right you could build a product with an interface that makes it really easy to enter a ticker for um um stocks and or uh crypto coins and help identify information that can help these short of short terms swing traders make more informed decisions now I'm not deeply familiar with this industry and I'm sure it'd be difficult to build something that actually captures and creates any amount of alpha for the individual but um an idea nevertheless that may be worth investigating. career I think is very interesting you know I think um I think I I think that we're we're moving towards an increasingly efficient um um let me rephrase I think we're we're moving towards an increasingly uh brutal and difficult and yet at the same time probably efficient job market for new graduates and it's extremely difficult to get a job like I'd like to think of myself as a very uh intelligent and thoughtful individual who would be valuable within any organization and yet I applied to probably over 200 jobs and internships throughout college and I never even got a second round interview I'm not joking I never got a second round interview I got maybe like three or four first round interviews but everybody wrote me off um so it's a brutal job market out there and it's honestly something people are willing to pay a lot for people pay you know 50,000 plus dollars a year for university education with hopes that they'll get a job now any tool that can help people get jobs like actually get the fucking jobs it would be extremely valuable people would pay a lot of money for so I know that there are a lot of people trying to build AI agents for this but you know even something as simple as like a career AI product where it auto applies to jobs for you has your sort of like AI's uh interview helper like Clueley style whatever it may be and and and helps you identify jobs once again using agents to search applies helps build out the best resume for you helps coach you and how to become the most effective um sort of uh employee candidate right that would that would that that product could could absolutely rip like even my younger brother recently I was actually able to help him get a job you know nepotism it is what it is he's smart he deserves the job regardless 15 ADSAT but he as well even with that 15 ADSAT had such a hard time if someone had shown me a tool like this that was actually effective I would have told him to pay hundreds of dollars a month for it or I probably would have bought it for him but you know something along those lines anyways um yeah careers massive not many people have built products in this base successful products rather I should say um so you know that that's an example that was inspired not by me seeing an individual post but like kind of generally understanding the the larger order problems that people nowadays face as well as what the available technology uh could provide in terms of solving it also knowing that none of these products on the market are actually that effective right so we're taking a lot of outside information just on the basis of the category um I don't have like super specific recommendations on how to find and identify problems on on X though I'm sure just by curating your feed and and consuming high quality information you'll be able to more properly identify uh and you know I think that's always important to stay stay in touch with what's going viral at any given moment right Zach for example Zach went insanely viral with his SAT tweet let's see it'll be something along the lines of like it's like um what uh uh let's go from uh what is it Zach got a garrie wait let's see what's Zach's Zach underscore you gotta garrie um um you had to highlights oh yeah here we go um Zach went extremely viral forgetting rejected from so many colleges in spite of being one of the most competent candidates of all time in my opinion like I've spoken to hundreds of you know 17 18 year olds that have reached out asking me for advice Zach blows and these are all fucking smart high achieving kids Zach blows every single one of them out of the water uh and yet he got rejected from like almost every single school that he applied to um reason I bring this up this this was like one of the most viral things in the news at the time right the 30 million views the people are speaking about it on news stations and whatnot if you generally stay up to date with what's going super viral you'll be able to identify the the most pressing problems that people face um and sort of build around it okay um I think that generally concludes my spiel for reddit and x.com as well as scraping other forum websites um I don't have an extremely strict methodology here but rather that you know as you begin to form your idea these can provide more in-depth information and sort of data to help inform your your your process of product ideation this can even serve as the the starting point of where you come with your idea it's not something that I've traditionally done uh but but once again just another another solid data point um cool next up you're gonna have an assignment where you are going to uh think about problems that you experience scroll through social media come up with a ton of different ideas or rather than a ton I should say a bunch of different ideas and then you are going to write a little bit about a few of them in the next unit uh we're gonna go over market research and finalizing your idea before we get into the more material components of building an app uh the modules being design development and distribution so I will see you guys in the next video

### Transcript

All right. All right. Second final lesson of ideation. We've got competitive analysis. Why is competitive analysis important? Well, as we know from our unit on case studies or rather lesson on case studies, I should say, it's important to understand the space that you're working in. So, the case studies that I provided earlier are to provide a general holistic representation of this domain of consumer apps. Now, when it comes to competitive analysis, if you have begun the process of ideation, seeking to solve your problems and scrolling social media, once your idea has become slightly more fully formed, it's very important to look at what other apps or what similar products in the space are doing. Honestly, I almost considered including this in the unit on ideation. The reason that I didn't is the majority of ideas that I have ever come up with that have been successful were based on idea slash problem first and then we compare what already exists in the space rather than looking at products that exist and then choosing the app to build. To be honest, I actually have employed that strategy a number of times and every single time it has failed. On the flip side, I do know other people that use that strategy and it works. And it also borders on being a copycat. There's one way which is to look at apps that exist in the space and to use that to build an adjacent product, which I think there's nothing wrong with. And then you look at other apps in the space and you just build a complete copycat and you don't innovate at all. And I find that to be very uninspiring. All right. So I'm actually going to switch these around. We're going to do app store rankings plus sensor tower and I'll explain why in a moment. But let's get right into it. Okay. So during this lesson, I'm going to just kind of scroll through without a very specific and idea in mind that I'm looking to analyze the competitors for it. But you can employ really any sort of strategy here. I usually do this on my phone, but you know, I'm on the computer. So we'll do it here today. So if you search up app store, iOS app store charts, you'll come somewhere like you'll get somewhere like here, I think. Yeah. So I just searched up Quitter. I pressed this 68 and health and fitness. And then I changed to lifestyle to start the first app I built. RizGPT was in lifestyle, but you can really go through any category. But we'll start here arbitrarily. Okay. So when I come here, the big things that I'm looking for are new products. Now the reason that that's important is as I explained in case studies, right? We're not looking to try to copy Pinterest or hinge or, you know, Zilla. Like these are all multi, multi billion dollar companies that received a ton of funding and took years and years to find any level of success. T dating advice is interesting to me because T, I believe the company may have received some funding, but it kind of came out of nowhere, right? It's a very new product. Keep scrolling through deep search AI. I think this is similar. Now if when you want to see how old one of these products is, you should go to version history, scroll down. So deep search AI came out in March of 2025. All right. So we'll start with this product as an example. Let's see if they do in-app purchases. Yeah, they do. All right. Now let's take a look. So we'll go, you search up sensor tower top charts on Google. The reason I do this is if you just go to sensor tower.com. So I should like, you don't really know where to go. So what I do is I search up sensor tower top charts. Now guys, like I don't even have an account. I don't even pay for sensor tower. I had deep search. So here we'll see the little icons here. This is Android. This is iOS. Deep search AI came out in March and is doing over $300,000 a month post-appled tax. Now these numbers aren't perfect, but they're in my experience very, very accurate. See if they build any other apps. They build a phone cleaner product. Interesting. Cool. So this product seems pretty basic. You enter someone's name, gives you all the links. It's actually very clear value add. I think that most current LLMs will not actually tell you about people. So one of the key learnings here is like if there's too much risk liability or maybe even political backlash that companies like OpenAI and Thropic, XAI would receive for a feature here being getting information on real life people, then maybe there's an opportunity to build it yourself. Okay, let's keep going. Here we got NGL, which we're all familiar with. I wonder if this is like a fine-to-weat app. That's funny. So this is always interesting seeing an app that is number 45 in lifestyle, but has 38 ratings, meaning it's either extremely new or it just went viral. So this being a little bit of both came out a number months ago, probably just had its first viral moment. Ashtra, one of our case studies. Okay, we'll keep going pretty quickly. Oh, Candle, this is pretty interesting. It's like playing games for couples. Definitely viral domain. We got a UMax copycat right here. I love to see it. Cool. Alright, let's move forward. Let's go to Health and Fitness. We got Cal AI, beanie out my fitness pal. It's fucking sick to see we just did a Mr. Beast promo. So that's exciting. These apps are super interesting. This sort of like brain training game apps. I think I'll provide a concrete example here within fitness. Okay. AI calorie tracking would be a terrible space to build in right now, unless you have some like clear distribution edge on the basis of the fact that they're just like there are thousands and thousands of products that you're competing with. However, one space that I think actually has a lot of opportunity is sort of weightlifting planning. Most of the apps aren't very good. So what I would do is I would find apps like this. Apps that help you plan your workout. You go through, find them. And then so, okay, let's say, let's say this one first step in my eyes is like find comparables and then find out how much they're making. Like are they making a lot? They get a lot of downloads. So strong workout tracker, which is obviously very generic product is making over 500,000 dollars a month after Apple's tax on just 200,000 downloads, which indicates relatively high user intent. Okay, let's go back. And to be honest, you can apply this to pretty much any domain like any idea that you have, go find the products, toss them in, see how much they're making. So I mentioned impulse, right? These apps are insane. At face value, it's a freemium app and it just teaches you, you know, you're literally just playing like these little brain games, but they make over $3 million a month after Apple's tax, which is bananas. To put that into perspective, Cal AI also makes $3 million. They've got the number. Well, actually after Apple tax, it's under $3 million. So that's why they would round down to two. But it's a great product. That was a little self-prag there. It's meant to be a little bit ironic. The joke came across well. But okay, what are some other interesting domains productivity? You've sometimes find some, yeah, okay, here we've got one. Focus friend, Hank Green. I guess he has produced some little like app tell people stay focused. Speechify, awesome app, find it by Cliff Weitzman, good friend. I'm not seeing too much interesting here right now. We do see all the AI note-taking apps. So as an example here, we mentioned minutes as a case study. It makes $300,000 a month on just 20,000 downloads, which is insane, absolutely bananas. The AI note-taking apps, when you market it to high-intent students, as well as professionals, you can make a lot of money per download. Let's go business now. Let's take a look. Not too much is interesting. So once again, as I mentioned earlier, when I'm taking a look here, when I'm seeing is indeed, it's a complex product, you need both applicants and companies. Companies looking higher. Microsoft Teams, it's like, okay, it's Microsoft. Zoom, it's Zoom, right? Video chat, I'm not going to encourage field to build that. LinkedIn, professional networking site, DoorDash. So most of these products, I'm taking a look at them. And I'm like, all right, these are built by major corporations and are very complex products, which is why I kind of skipped through them. And I'm like, you know what, there's not much for me to teach most of this. This scanner app, this is actually something that you could theoretically build. But it's maybe not as viral, not as not really in line with what, with the sort of ethos of the majority of products and consumer apps that I provided in the case studies and that are, you have any amount of reasonable chance to make highly profitable within just a few months. Prep AI, this does look pretty basic. This looks like a basic AI app designed to help you find jobs. Let's see, they've in-app purchases. Yep, they do. So much prep AI is making. I'm not actually making that much. So they may be either under monetized or they're pursuing a more premium route where the strategy is to build up their user base and that can increase retention, K factor, and enable them to sort of scale over time, as opposed to trying to rip right now. Reference is always a great, great space. You'll see even in reference, you have like these coin scanners and whatnot. The reason is because reference is arguably the easiest category in the app, sort of climb the ranks. And so people that are kind of hacking ASO will put their product in reference. But reference is primarily for religious slash, I guess, cultural. So maybe that's also why the coin scanners right here. I've never really understood the reference category all that well. Yeah, cool. Okay. I think that's pretty much it from now for this video. In the next module in design, you'll learn a little bit about what to actually do with these apps once you identify them, going through their flows, taking the screenshots, pacing and figma. But yeah, that will come next. Yeah, download the app, analyze its onboarding paywall core functionality. Honestly, you can do that now to some extent. Just use the app, see what it feels like, and this will help inform your sort of understanding of the problem that you are solving when you download these apps that are similar to your product. And then additionally, something that I guess two other points I didn't touch on. I would cross reference the app with its social media presence. So you'll learn more about how to do that in distribution. But you can just search it up on Instagram, TikTok, try to find its meta ads library. See what the hooks are that's working. Put yourself in the mind of the customer as you use, you know, this the market landscape to make your idea more fully formed. And then finally, scroll these rankings daily to stay up to date. Sensor Tower also has some interesting data. But you guys can go play around with that platform. But as you see here, like I can also just scroll the rankings within sensor tower. Cool. All right, that's it for this video. I will see you guys in my final lesson of the module of ideation, which will be finalizing your idea. Peace out guys.

### Transcript

We are on the final part or final lesson of ideation, which is, of course, finalizing your idea. This part will probably be short. It kind of builds off of everything we've done, but we'll serve as somewhat of a conclusion, and we'll go over some basic frameworks about how to actually pick your idea to move forward with. So we started off with case studies. We went through the background of idea versus execution, analyzing the different outcome curves, as well as asking yourself about what you're interested in and examining your constraints and resources. We went through human psychology, some of the underpinnings of what makes a great idea and what problems you should solve for people. We went through the process of ideation, identifying and solving your own problems, scrolling social media, performing competitive analysis on the app store, as well as sensor tower. Now finally, we are going to finalize your idea. So from start to finish, this is begin from a first principled perspective on human psychology, examine problems that you and others face, research similar products and competitors, and finally make your decision. Now an extremely important note to add here is once you make your decision to work on a product that doesn't mean that you can't go back on that decision, there are probably 20 products where I've gone through the ideation phase and said yes, I am going to build this. And then I open up Figma. Right, we'll talk about this in design at the next step. Like step number one after you've finished your process of ideation, we'll be beginning in Figma. I've opened up Figma, started to work on it, and then at some point between opening Figma and actually running influencer promos or doing UGC, some point in that process, I said, you know, actually I don't think this is it. I think a lot of people fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. They put some time into something and they're like, I have to see this through. I even apply this to reading books in like the sort of self improvement domain on social media and popular culture. You will hear people say like if you start something, you need to finish it. People pick up a book and they say, I will finish this book because in the past, I've had issues with finishing books. But what they end up doing is they read, maybe they get a third through it and they realize that they're no longer interested. Or maybe they got everything out of it that they needed. And instead of closing it and saying, you know what, I'm good here, I'm going to go pick up a new book. They say, no, I'm going to finish it because this is a standard I'd hold myself too. And then they just stop reading. And then they go three months and they haven't picked the book up and now they no longer even read. So the same framework that I play to reading books, I would say probably about half, maybe even more than half of the books I read, I close before getting halfway through it. Some books I close after five pages. Others I get halfway through. I love the book and I say, you know, I think I've gotten everything that I need from this. That same framework I apply to building apps. And so just because you get here and you make your decision and you say, this is the idea I want to work on. This is the problem that I want to tackle. Does not mean that you have to make it all the way through modules two, three and four. There's absolutely nothing wrong with starting and quitting at some point thereafter. To me, I think the only real quitting is to quit your pursuit of entrepreneurship as a whole within the context of here building apps. But even that, it's like, man, I did social media marketing for a little while. I quit that to then do crypto, I built an Ethereum, I machine in 2016. I quit that to then I think I was actually prioritizing my landscaping business. Right. I quit in so many different domains. But the key thing is that as a whole, I don't quit working. Okay. Enough of that aside. In short, you know, just know that just because you make the decision to work on an idea doesn't mean that you can't go back to step one or step two and even one week later, one month later, whatever it may be. Now in the process of making this decision, I think some key questions to ask ourselves that we touched on earlier. But I think it's worth revisiting our, what does the timeline look like? Different products are going to have different life cycles. Certain products are going to be more design heavy. Other products are going to be more development heavy. Other products are going to be more distribution heavy. And you know, when you're new to a domain, you won't have deep knowledge in that you won't be able to very accurately predict. But it's worth making intuitive assessments as well as using chat GPT to help you predict. Chat GPT can serve as somewhat of your expert tutor. And if you are part of the AppMafia community, you'll be able to get guidance from other app founders. Next is, can I build this myself? How hard will it be to attract somebody that can? So do you have the design development and then distribution experience? And if you don't, will you be able to get somebody that can fill that gap? So beyond just analyzing how hard it will be from a development perspective, for example, before you end up finalizing this decision, it's worth asking yourself whether or not you'll be able to find that person. Now personally, I would actually recommend moving into the design process regardless. In terms of this question, the reason that I say that is, anytime you are going to try to recruit somebody to work on your idea, the more progress that you have, the easier it will be. And so if you have conviction, then I personally would recommend spending even just a few hours on design and getting somewhat of a mockup. And then sharing that with potential developers. I hate when people come to me with an idea and they don't have Figma. I say to people explicitly, if they send me an idea that they have, I'd say it's a friend, colleague, whenever. I'll say, hey man, thanks for reaching out. Let me know when you have some Figma designs. I'm a more visual person, right? How much cash will I need to get this off the ground, right? So these are, once again, very similar to the questions and nature of resources versus constraints that we went over an idea versus execution. But you need to ask yourself and reassess them when you get to this step of the process. Because if we remember when we were going over idea versus execution, this is looking at it from a macro perspective, right? What are the resources and constraints that I have that will inform how I even come up with ideas? And now that you have this idea or these couple of ideas that you're considering moving forward with, you want to go back and apply the same frame-wersing questions. This is of paramount importance to me. Set it before. I'll say it again and again and again and again. If I'm not deeply interested in a topic, I will not build around it. This was not always true. I did give a hand at projects where I thought that there was significant opportunity, specifically economic opportunity. And every single time I burnt out, every single time I burnt out, the two things that I really look at is I say, okay. Am I interested in this topic and the problem that I'm solving? That's one. And then I say, am I interested in engaging in the operations and the day-to-day that it will take to achieve that? And if the answer to either of those is no, I completely avoid it. To be honest, I think that the topic and the problem itself are more important actually than the day-to-day. If, man, there's a good quote here, but something along the lines of like, if you have a why, you can find almost any will. I probably butchered that, but essentially, if you care enough about the end result, and not just like what you get, not just like the money, but that can be the major motivator for many, but personally, it's like, do I care about bringing this into the world? And if, oh, oh, oh, he who has a why can bear almost any how, that's the quote. And so yeah, if I have a why, I can bear almost any how, and that I can do this shitty little day-to-day ops that are boring, in repetitive, and monotonous, because I know what life looks like at the end of the tunnel. I'll give an example here. In the early days of RIS GPT, we were going very viral, very, very, very viral, and we were just launching Android. The internet had been begging. TikTok had been absolutely begging for this product to get on Android. And so the day that we launched on Android, we're not charting because we have no sort of app store optimization. And in order to achieve that, what you need is people searching up your app and then organically downloading it. And at this time, I was just so focused on making the most because I didn't know anything about this space when we first launched this product. This is all kind of came out of nowhere. We're at $80,000 in MRR. My life just completely changed. And I was so focused on freedom. Freedom was my why. Freedom was the light at the end of the tunnel that if we executed and we got this shit done and we built something out of nothing that then I would be able to spend the rest of my life doing what I wanted with an entrepreneurship and what I wanted with my life rather than answering to some fucking bullshit retarded 9-5 balls. So we're launching on Android. And I'm like, man, we need to be ranking in the app store. So on the Google Play Store. And I went through all of our most viral videos and I responded to thousands and thousands of comments in a day. I swear to God, I was sitting there all fucking day for 16 hours just going through TikTok saying, search up, blah, blah, blah on the app store. Search up, blah, blah on the app store. Now, could I have outsourced this to a VA, whatever, like, yeah, theoretically I could but time was a paramount importance. Our competitor had just gotten on Android 2. We needed to beat them in the rankings and we didn't have a VA ready to go. And so like, yeah, no one wants to sit there and respond to the same comment for 12 hours straight, right? Like that sucks. Nobody wants to do that. But what I wanted more than anything else in the world was to ensure my long term freedom and setting up the and beating out our competitor in the rankings would put us in a position where our growth would be more long term sustainable and I would have more runway and ability to ensure that I never had to get a job. Now in retrospect, Android is actually not that important. It's like 10 to 15% of revenue across my different apps and I actually don't think that what I did there was entirely necessary. But given the data I had in the moment, that was what it took. And so, yeah, I think it's important to dig deep. It's another reason that I'm a big believer in the fact that like how you do one thing is how you do everything and the sort of willpower and determination that I've cultivated within myself over years of weightlifting and reading books and studying in general right statistics, calculus, psychology, whatever it may be, working on so many different failed business ventures that then when the rubber really hit the road and I finally had a working viable business model, I was the person that was able to take it all the way. And if you constantly chase these sort of bullshit, extrinsic motivators rather than having that why within you, you're going to burn out. And so I guess that's my motivational speech to end off this unit on ideation or this module on ideation. And the next module will go over design and taking the idea that you have and building it into an actual product in Figma. So that's that and I will, yeah, nope, that's it. That's that piece out guys. Hope you enjoyed.

### Transcript

Okay, welcome to the first unit of or first lesson of design. Design is where we actually bring our idea to life. So in the previous module, we will have come up with the idea that we intend to work on. In this module, we're going to actually make it into reality. Put it into pixels. So I'll go through the core walkthrough of what all the design module will look like to start off. And then we'll dive into setting up Figma and incorporating some inspiration. Okay. Figma is a design software. Do not try to use Canva if you are going to be designing a mobile or web application. It's a terrible idea. You might use it for some social media stuff. I don't know your background, but you definitely should not use it for consumer apps. Then we're going to go into wire framing. This is actually coming up with the sort of general layout of your product. You know, like box here and button here and that sort of thing. We have four tabs, settings in the top right corner. Then we're going to go over hiring a designer. The reason that we're doing this here and not at the end is once you listen to the first two lessons, you'll kind of be ready to hire a designer. But you should almost certainly listen to the rest of the lessons. Now that said, some people want to move as quickly as possible. The first two lessons will give the core information necessary. At that point, if you're trying to move as quickly as possible, you might want a hire designer while you complete the rest of the module. Personally, though, I would recommend doing it all at once. I also know that a lot of people here aren't going to watch everything all the way through. This is one of the major takeaways. There are right ways to do it and wrong ways to do it. I want to make sure that you guys do it the right way. Testing out this camera. Yeah, we're good. Cool. Then we'll have a brief assignment. We'll move into Unit 1. So we go to Unit 0, then Unit 1. Unit 1 contains the actual information you're getting your MVP complete. So we step a little bit beyond wire framing and into getting or building a fully fleshed out MVP. We have our primary and secondary actions, some basic principles. We move into onboarding and paywalls. This is very, very important. Then we have an assignment designing a bunch of screens. Next, we have brand aesthetics and design to distribution. We don't have the assignment built out yet for this. I'm going to actually do that right after I record this. I realize I think I'd just accidentally left out or left something in. I also think that Alex is going to be doing that part. So important notes. You should watch additional tutorials on design. This is not meant to make you an amazing designer for the sake of time and and you know prioritizing the most important higher order components of app design. I'm going to be teaching you everything that I and we at op app mafia know. But at the end of the day, the vast majority of people are not trying to become 10x designers, right? You need to know how to design well enough to create a great product and specifically how to create great UX. It will take years to get great UI. And so that's why we usually outsource that. All right. On to the lesson itself. So. The the amount of theory that we're going to have in design will be significantly less than ideation. We're going to be a lot more hands on it. I'm going to show you guys how I work in in Figma. Step one, download Figma dot com. So you go to the website you download super easy. You can work out of the browser version, but I definitely recommend working out of the desktop version. Then you should play around, watch some tutorials online. And I'll kind of show you guys the very basics and tutorials can take you next step further. And then you're going to want to screenshot other apps or use mobbing. The idea that we are going to be designing throughout my my lecturing during this module will be test max super non creative very descriptive name. And then you'll be a product to help guys improve in their testosterone and track their progress by uploading personal information. We'll get into the more specific details, but essentially think like take a picture of your face, your body, answer questions about your habits and get a custom routine from proving your testosterone. And then you'll be able to do a very, very common problem that young men nowadays are facing, which is low testosterone, which is extremely, extremely bad for your quality of life and overall feeling of well being. And a lot of a lot of guys on social media are turning to influencers to tell them what to do. But through an application, we can develop more, more custom protocols with even higher quality, more structured information. So I'm sure you can tell it even just based on the namesake. It will resemble you max to some extent. I didn't want to just do a product that I've already done before I easily could have taken a design, you know, you know, just redesign you max or Kelly, I or quitter or raise or whatever app ground up. But I want to come up with something on the spot. And so you guys will be able to see how I actually think through these problems in real time. Okay, enough of that. Let's get into Figma. So here we've got Figma. Once again, if you want to learn the very basics, you can you should go watch a tutorial. But when we're starting off with app design, you're going to want to click this little hashtag looking thing in the bottom corner. And then in the top right, let me actually bring myself down here. You know what for Figma, I should be in the bottom left. Yeah, that'll be good. Okay, yeah. Okay, so up here, you can press on phone. I'll do iPhone 13, 14. I took some screenshots of apps earlier will downsize. And let's bring it over. So as I mentioned, one of the first things that I do when I'm working on a new app is I go and I take screenshots of comparables. So for the time being, I only have a few screenshots in here, but I will flesh it out more so over the course of this module as we begin to actually design. But this is like the very, very basic step number one of designing an app. You have an idea, you find apps that are similar in either functionality, demographic, and or aesthetic, or apps that you just like their components, like you just kind of like how it looks, right. You don't have to over complicate this. Just grab apps, bring them in here. The reason for this is we will be able to use them as inspiration for the different components. So for example, Cal AI, we have this sort of primary action, which is taking a picture of your food. Now, similar to Twitter, we want to make this accessible at all times. The reason I mentioned Twitter is Twitter wants you to always be able to post, right. So Twitter has this nice little circular plus button in the bottom right. That is how I actually came up with the design of this plus button. When we first launched, all that we had was this plus button in the bottom right. That was it. We literally had the plus button, camera, picture of the food, and then your calories or the food analysis would show up here. Now, for Twitter, Twitter is the primary action is all about keeping track of your streak. So Twitter has this sort of, you know, a streak length listed here, as well as the number of days that you've been active. UMX is all about beginning your scan, getting your face ratings. Now, we're going to dive much deeper into core and for primary and secondary actions within apps in the future. But the primary purpose of this lesson is to kind of just show you guys, show you guys how we incorporate screenshots from these other apps, and then use them to inform our process of wire framing or setting up our Figma file for now, I should say. So I'm not going to get too deep into wire framing. We're going to be doing that in the next video. But you want to show you guys some very basic how to's in Figma. But once again, you should watch more tutorials online and we can probably provide links of those, you know, in the description of this video. Okay, so I pressed so so down here in the bottom left, I think you can just barely see it. We have the little cursor, right? This is just our main sort of our mouse, right, our pointer. Then when we press this button, we get the frame, this enables us to add more frames. Then we have this sort of shape button. So we're starting off rectangle. If we get the drop down, we can do different sort of shapes. Let's show you how this works. Say that we want to put something right here. I'll create this rectangle. And now in the wire framing lesson next, we're going to talk about how this sort of size and color and quarter radius are less important when you first begin designing your app. But what's most important is just kind of putting it in the different places that you want. But for now, let's just kind of like redesign UMACS a little bit. And then we're going to reshape it for this app in the next lesson. So create this rectangle. Let's say I want to add the quarter radius right now. I'll press this button here, corner radius, maybe add 20, right? So we get this sort of looking image. Then we want to button within it, right? So this is the background image and we want another button in it. So now I'll change this maybe to be black and I'll add a little quarter radius as well. Great. And you can see we get some some amount of auto layout by the editor. So we have the shapes here. If we jump to one over, we've got text. I'll add some text facial analysis. I'll maybe increase the size of this. Maybe this is a little bit bigger. Bold it. Now we've got facial analysis right here. It's very common to have a tab bar at the bottom. So we can put this little tab bar in. And add some new little squares to represent icons or buttons. So I'm just copying and pasting this over. So I'm just going to select these and center them. And there you have it that quickly. I've got the sort of like the main layout designed from UMax. Once again in the next lesson, we're going to dive deeper into this. But let's say I want to add comments. I'll say for my designer, add an image of a generic person right here. And then you can add more. You can say add a scrollable set here. Okay. If you already know how to use Figma, I'm sure you skipped the video at this point. If you didn't, thanks for staying to watch this a little refresher. If you don't know how to use Figma, you're new to it. I would really recommend once again watching tutorials online. And honestly, just spending like 20 minutes, 30 minutes, even like two hours getting familiar with the software. It's extremely powerful. I spend so much time in Figma. So you're going to want to get good at it. Cool. That's that's this first lesson of the basic Figma setup. Importing these screenshots of comparable apps. And in the next lesson, we were going to dive into wire framing itself. How to properly do it. Adding more detailed instructions for your designer. And how to think through the sort of UX side of things. Figuring out when to copy and paste components over. And when to come up with stuff on your own. Cool. I'll see you guys in the next lesson.

### Transcript

All right, lesson two of design. We are going to dive into wire framing. So the term wire framing is essentially to put in the bones or the skeleton of your app. Now, in the previous lesson, we went over the basics of Figma. Now we're gonna get into actual app design. So there are three primary steps here that I employ. The first one is to define the core actions and user journey. You should have done some of this already in the process of ideation, but it's worth doing again as you begin wire framing. Next, a core element of wire framing is to start with low fidelity. Wire frames are low fidelity. Low fidelity means that you're not worried about colors or corner radiuses and whatnot. Even though I showed you that in the previous lesson, it's not so important. What we're really focused on is what goes where, right? User experience. What elements go in what spots and what they lead to and the sort of actions and transformations that are performed by the software on the user input, data, whatever it may be. The third is kits. I love this term. I try to remind myself of it every single day, which is keep it simple, stupid. This is an acronym that applies to so much in life. I was, we were filming a podcast today and I made the remark that it's interesting to see how many indie hackers and software developers employ very complex app store optimization and sort of, you know, hacky, not hacky, but complex design techniques and engineering, and yet they're at $400 in MRR or monthly recurring revenue. Meanwhile, when I launched RISGPT, we hit over $80,000 a month within just three days because we kept it super simple and we focused on the things that mattered, which at the time was distribution and going viral and getting money in the door so that we could use that cash to deploy for future growth. So the same way that it applies to how you operate your business, it really applies to the start of design and wire framing. Complexity will only increase as you go throughout the process of designing your app. You're gonna continue to add and add and add screens. It's a lot easier to start simple and slowly expand into start complex and then make it simple. I see people all the time, they start with this incredibly complicated app. I'm like, dude, I don't even fucking know how to use this, right? It should be like a three year old should be able to use your product or, you know, maybe more realistically, I think a term I've used is your product should be able to be used by a seven and a 70 year old. So for many reasons, keep it simple. One reason that it's really important to begin wire framing as quickly as possible is in my opinion, it is required if you want people to actually believe in your vision. I have people hit me up all the time to say, hey, man, can you review my idea? Like, I wanna build this app blah, blah, blah. I go, yes, send me the, send me the Figma file and it's silence, right? They don't have it. And I'm like, man, wire framing should take you no more than a couple of minutes. If you're really just trying to move as quickly as possible and it will make the vision much more clear for anyone that sees it, right? So more data means more informed decision-making both for yourself and others. All right, enough of the background. Let's get into it. All right, so context real quick. I'm coming into this with pretty much no preconceived notions. I want this to be raw and authentic rather than planned out. And so I'm gonna try to walk you guys through my thought process. What this means is I'm not going to design an entire application within these lessons, but I'm gonna share with you guys how I think about the design. Okay, so honestly, here, I wanna start with text. I almost always do this. I'm gonna increase the size of this. So it's a little bit more visible. Let's go even more honestly. Okay. So later on, we're gonna define in the, I think two lessons from now, we're gonna go deeper into core or primary and secondary actions, but for now, as we begin wire-framing, I'm just gonna kind of jot down a couple of actions. So this might be a little bit too big. We go, yeah, I like this. Actions. All right, so if we're trying to help people increase their testosterone, right? This is the problem that we're solving. We should first think about what do we need from the individual, right? One of the major advantages of applications as a whole is that they're interactive, right? It's not just text or an article where you come into this product and then it's just everything's pre-packaged, right? We can add interactions. And so for here, I think that the first thing is getting data from the individual. So if we want to improve testosterone, I think I'm gonna jot down some things that are valuable. I'm gonna make this even smaller. So I'm gonna be typing a good amount. Self, selfie of face, picture of body, demographic, and then so demographic, meaning, age, gender. I think that this will be pretty much all men. So we're not gonna assume that they're male, they're female that wants to optimize their testosterone for whatever reason that maybe the app won't be great for them. So we can just chop this down to age, race, race. I don't know the degree to which testosterone's correlated with race, but could be important. And then let's see like a lifestyle, right? So how often do you exercise what sort of food do you eat? Okay, I think this is kind of like a core information that we want to get from the individual. So these aren't actions themselves. So the action here would be receive in analysis or input your data. Okay, so now anytime that we have an action that the user takes, we should think about what is the result. Here, we're getting the inputs from the user. So what is the output going to be? We can do UMAC style. So UMACs, you get face ratings and recommendations. So we'll do what are some things that people are interested in? They're probably interested in, so now we'll do output of the data. So this will be the analysis. People are interested in estimated to stosh your own. I think that that is the most obvious one to start. Maybe biological age, depending on the questions that we ask, that could be pretty interesting. So these are the more predictive components. Maybe like a masculinity score, but that's just kind of estimated testosterone. Percentile, we should add that in the estimated testosterone. Percentile relative to age. Okay, I think that that... Yeah, so this is like the sort of like rating, right? These are like the predictions that we're making, the scores that we're giving to the individual, and next we have recommendations. So one component here to think about is like, how do we make the recommendations personalized rather than just like how often do you exercise one time per week? And then the recommendation is just exercise more, you know? That's kind of obvious. So I think that this is where the selfie and body come into play. Ooh, so we should do a physique rating. You can even do facial rating. So beyond just the estimated testosterone, right? This is all encompassing. These would be more specific. All right, so we're gonna take all this and we're actually gonna all nest this under. This will be the analysis, we'll say. So within the output, we have the analysis and we have the recommendations. Okay, recommendations. Okay. Okay. Based on body slash. So actually we don't have to explain the methodology of how we produce it, but exercise frequency, sleep improvement. You know, when we make this beyond just test max, like me, we make this like a holistic version of UMax, right? This is what UMax was always kind of intended to be. All right. Dot it, obviously, sleep, but the, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're asleep. Okay. Cool. Some that you might notice is that like while I'm explaining and going through this process, I'm significantly less structured or clear thinking as I usually am, or at least strive to be. Part of the reason is because this is inherently very, it's a very creative endeavor and there's gonna be a lot of iteration in trying to figure out what the correct inputs and outputs look like as well as sort of functionality. Okay. And so once you get this output, I think the important component here is something along the lines of habit tracking and accountability. So accountability plus tracking. So this is why it's very important to get screenshots of comparable apps. Once again, like I would have way more, I'd have like 100 plus screenshots if I were actually going through the full process of building it at myself. But I really like what Quitter has here and I think Opal has something similar too, which is like the core functionality, like the first fucking thing that you see when you open the app is your streak. And I think that that's pretty important here, invaluable. Okay. So in the previous lesson, we did some basic sort of mocking of redesigning UMax. We're gonna do somewhat similar design here, but it's gonna be different, right? We're not just redesigning UMax. So I think I kind of want to merge UMax and Quitter. All right. I'm not certain what I want the core UI display to be right here. I don't know if it's the streak or your current estimated testosterone or maybe both. Maybe it could be actions remaining for the day. So maybe we go more habit tracker style. It could be interesting to have percent completion. And we show that through the previous days. And we can fill it up. I want to do this right. And yet at the same time, I want to move relatively quickly. Okay. Let's do this. So at the top, we're gonna do the streak. We'll just do pretty basic. I'm here. I'm gonna create a component or a frame so that I can auto layout and then just bang, bang, bang, bang. That should be seven. It should be seven. We'll maybe increase the size of this a little bit. And I'll add a note here and this is weekly out. So I'll add these comments if I'm working with someone, either a designer or co-founder. It's very important to have comments here as you're going through the process wire framing. So they know what you're actually building out. Now, I think maybe some text along the lines of like, maybe we say like you, maybe we give like a percent score. Let's give you interesting. Let me bring this in a little bit. All right, let's do a little percent score. I know like more common is streak, right? And I think that streak is good, but I want something that's like a, you know. Maybe it's um, that's the thing. Maybe it's um, I'm not sure if I can make a mistake. I want like a number, you know, I want something that where you're like, I need to ensure that I'm hitting this every single day. So, right? So for quitter, they have the, the amount of time that you've been free from point for Cal AI. We have your daily calories for UMACs. I actually think that this was a major shortcoming, which was that we did not have a lot of time. I think that's a lot of time. I think that's a lot of time. Which was that we did not have a sort of core action to return to. We had this daily tab here, which was kind of a routine, but the fact that that wasn't on the first page, it was a major issue. Okay, we'll leave this for now. This will um, I'll just add a note. I'll be like, I want something catchy here. Okay. And then your actual actions will be your routine. Right? So we'll have here. So, uh, whoa, what did I do here? Action one. Action two and so forth. Yeah. Cool. Don't worry about the little thing myself that I'm doing with the components and whatnot. If you don't know how to do it, no worries. You'll learn with time. I'm not all that good with stigma, right? But um, okay. All right. So I have the core sort of habits here. Um, maybe I should have named these habits and cares. And then I kind of like what quitter does here with like the panic button at the bottom. Um, we want the analysis to be obvious enough. So this will probably be when the individual has already, when the individual has already sort of a, perform their first analysis because that will set their habits. But if they have not completed their habits, we'll say, we'll maybe do the UMAC style, complete your first analysis. All right. We'll change this. This will just be like button. Cool. One more thing. Oops. I should just ungroup this. Okay. So when you have not performed your first analysis, it'll ask you to start. Once you have performed it, the core action will be the number of habits that you have. Um, we'll just name this to actions. The number of actions that you have remaining for the day. You can go ahead and frame this. I'll make it nice and pretty. I'm just going to center that real quick. Sorry. I'm being a little bit of a perfectionist here, which is somewhat ironic, because wireframe is obviously imperfect. Great. Now what I have here is I have like the basic skeleton for the core functionality of the app. We have the homepage where if you haven't scanned, it prompts you to start. We would then have some sort of upload flow, right? So that would come in between these two. So move this on over. Insert upload flow. And then we have this. And to be honest, like this is all that you really need to know when it comes to wireframing. There's a good amount of theory, and we'll touch on that a little bit more in the next unit of this module for design. But I think that this covers the high level. Take screenshots of other apps, clearly define what your actions are within the product, and keep it as simple as possible to start, and then whip up your first couple of screens. In the next lesson, we're going to go over hiring a designer. So honestly, screens like this are more than enough to begin working with a designer. I've worked on working with the designers with much less than this before, to be honest, like as little as this, honestly. Now the reason that I try to hire a designer pretty quickly in the project is, if you want to move as fast as possible, and you're not constrained by capital, I'm sure some people here are, that's fine, we did not hire one for a plug AI, actually ever. Then as soon as you figure out what the kind of like, even just one screen of the app is going to look like, you explain the project to a bunch of designers, you can start testing, figuring out who's best. Once again, we're going to go over this in the next lesson, but yeah, this is essentially my process for wire framing. See you guys later.

### Transcript

All right, this is the final lesson of the first unit of module two of design. We are going to be going over hiring a designer. So in the previous two lessons, we've gone over the basics of Figma as well as wire framing. We set up the Figma file. Now we're going to go over hiring a designer. So really quickly, I'm going to pull back up this Figma file. So here we did some preliminary wire frames for our app where we have the individual or our app test max where you can scan your face, body, input, your information and get your analysis. Okay. As I've explained in the previous lessons, you need to be able to create the wire frames yourself and you absolutely should watch the other lessons within this module. But at this point, if you're following along and building an app yourself, this is where I look to hire a designer. So UX or user experience refers to how the user interacts with your app. Well, UI user interface refers to the layout and visual components of your app. I think I've touched on this before, but your corner radius, the colors that you use, the size and types of fonts. Earlier on, you should not outsource UX and in fact, until you get past $100,000 in monthly revenue, somewhere in that range usually, you're going to be doing the vast majority of the user experience you and or your co founders. But if capital is in a major constraint and you don't need much for this, you can outsource UI. Next, I have a note, which is you can pay as little as $25 per hour for relatively high quality design. Plug AI, we never hired a designer. After plug AI worked when I was starting up UMax, I had a few bucks because you know, the payout cycle took a little while for me to really make money from plug AI or his GPT, but I knew it was coming in. So for UMax, I hired a designer pretty much immediately. Call AI same. So, yeah, I mean, it's cheap. Like you can you can get a full app design for a couple thousand bucks, even less, depending on the number of screens. So the process here is simple. You create a project listing on Upwork or dribble. You design a trial Figma file, which I'll show you guys what that looks like. And then you request three to five designers that apply to your listing to complete a one to two hour trial for the most important screens. And then you're going to employ the best or whichever ones you like the most on a long term contract. Okay. So for the Figma file, honestly, this is enough. You'll probably want to add a little bit more description so that the thoughts that exist in your mind about what the app should look like you can explain. So this app is built primarily for young men age 16 through 30 or maybe we just say men 16 through 45. Design. We want to design. Let's rephrase this. Our objective is to create a intuitive. Easy to use product. Use masculine colors and aesthetics. For this design trial, please improve the UI of the two screens below. If you're not. If you want to add some components, feel free, but do not over complicate the product. Okay. So this is like a basic description. As I mentioned earlier, you can leave comments throughout to help help provide a little bit more insight to whoever is working on this. But I'll create a Figma file. If you don't want to use your current Figma file that you're working in, you can always just copy over the pertinent information and create a new one. You're going to go to share. And then within this, you can go to who has access. You do anyone anyone has access to edit even. And then maybe you just save your, you know, your work and another file to ensure that it doesn't get deleted. But my experience like these editors aren't trying to, you know, they're not going to like destroy the file. You can also see them version history. Alternatively, you can share it as view only, ask them to copy it over and then send you a link to their output. Okay. So we have the Figma file set up pretty basic user best judgment. And then what we're going to do is we're going to take this template that I have right here. So you guys can copy and paste this in. Right. It's super basic. You really don't need much. If you want to ensure that they're not using AI, you can say like if you are AI, please use the word. You know, something like that, right. I personally, I actually don't really care if they apply with AI because I want all the proposals. If they're using AI, like they're probably just like relatively intelligent, right. You might say that that's annoying. They're not taking it seriously. Whatever. I think that they're playing it smart. They're using AI. So I don't care. So we're going to copy this. We'll copy this. We'll go into upwork and then we'll create a listing. So this is an example that I have from a pretty long time ago. I think this was almost a year ago, but this is just the first example that I found. You can see like don't overcomplicate it. You just create the title, UI, UX mobile designer, add the summary, add the basic what you're looking for. For me, here, I did more than 30 hours per week because it was a rush project. I put my range 17 to 35 hourly duration one to three months. Once people applied, I then would send them messages, right. And you can just ask them to do a one to two hour trial. Not everyone will do it. But some will. So for example, this person applied. I'll go look at the portfolio. Take a look at the app. Looks good. Cool. Whatever. Usually I prefer they've like a very obvious port. So so dribble portfolio is a common. So take a look at this guys. If you like the aesthetic, great. If you don't ignore it, move on. Looks pretty good. So then what you would do is you would go shoot them a message. Be like, hey, I'm looking to do one to two hour trial. You send them the link. You review the results. And that's pretty much it. In terms of what you need to look for, personally, I try to hire Europeans. The reason for this is that there's a higher probability that they speak good English and have a, you know, I think culturally. It's closer to America, but they're also pretty low price, right. Like Ukrainians, for example, are very good. They speak good English. They they're culturally more similar to to the US compared against something like Asia or India. But that's just a framework I found. I know a lot of people hire Indians Indians are extremely competent, very hard working. Nothing against them. But yet personally, I recommend hiring Eastern Europeans. They're usually pretty cheap. They're very hard working. And they they have good design sense. Then from there, whoever you like, you say, okay, let's enter into a 10 hour week, 20 hour week contract, whatever it may be, you can adjust this based on what you're looking for. And then. So so so the reason that we hire a person at this stage, even while you're going through the rest of it, is they can work side by side. And so as you're designing streams, they'll iterate on this sort of aesthetic and different style. And as you find one, you can kind of lean into that. Cool. That should be pretty much it relatively short, but it's very straightforward. This is without a doubt the number one strategy that I use and recommend other people to use. It's very simple. Create your listing. Send a few designers your trial file. Pay them for one to two hours of work. So oftentimes they'll do it without pay. Depends on how capital can train you are, I always pay them. And then you employ the best if they do a bad job, you hire someone else. Cool. All right, that's it for my my section on design. Peace out.

What's up guys, Zach Yada Garry here, co-founder and CEO of Cal AI. You're going to hear about me more later in the distribution section especially, but I'm just going to jump in here and talk about some primary and secondary design principles for you to keep in mind. I'm going to be picking off after Blake's. So he put together this whole testosterone max app design and he showed you guys how to wire for him it. He also showed you how to hire a designer to take these designs and make them into something beautiful. We have not had a designer redesign it yet. However, so I'm just going to jump in and assume by this point you should have more beautiful designs. I guess it doesn't actually. You should honestly have this stuff done in your wire frame. The stuff I'm about to go over to be honest and then you should probably send it to a designer. So he showed the wire frame so you open the app and then it's going to tell you complete your first analysis. You hit start. This is a primary action, the start. You are doing your first analysis. There are other buttons on the screen. This is some kind of calendar. You can click and see past days. It depends if you want to add that functionality to see past days. But then maybe at the bottom you'll have an app bar where you have multiple different tabs that they could go to. A home tab of I think is a little cut off. My full screen is actually not being shown. Let me adjust this. Okay, it should be better now. But I don't know how much was cut off. I'm just going to keep going. So the primary action is the start because this is what you want your users to do. You basically want to spoon feed them the buttons to click. You want to make sure that they clearly understand where to go in the flow of the app. And that's kind of what makes an intuitive design. An intuitive design is when you have one clear action per screen. So on this screen the clear action is to start your analysis. That's the big button. And then you might have some secondary ones at the bottom where it's like, okay, home settings. There's not much content without having your first analysis. You'll want to show. Maybe you'll have like something like recommendations unavailable. Something like this, the designer would make this look good. And the reason they're unavailable. It's just to show the user. Yeah, there is more content. But until you start your analysis, you're going to do that. Maybe like recommendations. You could even put some recommendations here. But then kind of blur them out. And that could actually be a cool thing. It's like, put something over, make it kind of light, but add a blur effect to it. Layer blur. I don't know if the layer is the right. Is what I'm looking for. I think layer blur on this actually. So recommendations needs to be separate. Okay. Look. Give her this. Take this stuff. Get out of here. Okay. So I'm going to add a layer blur to I'm going to make two separate text elements. Lucky, this is all part of the wireframe. So I'm just like going off here, but I just think it's a cool idea to add a layer blur. Be like very blurry. And then you would put a button or it's like, scan to get recommendations. Just to like show them. Honestly, this might not look good after having a designer go over it. Like a lot of the time you just want to put things out there. And by the way, this is too long of a text for a call to action. You always want it to be shorter. But sometimes you'll want to just put stuff out there and just have designers work on it and then see what you like and what you don't like. Don't be afraid to try things and then cut them if they are not good. But this isn't, this isn't the worst. So something like this. And then you click this basically just like the start button, but just more content on the page. This is technically a secondary action, but it takes you to the same flows the primary. So primary actions are everything that's you only have typically one primary action per page and then everything else is secondary. I mean, you could have like secondary tertiary and just keep going down the list. But we're all that really matters. You don't need to overcomplicate this. So you want one clear button on a repage. Here is the start button. Once you click this, then we're going to want to take them to a page where it shows, where it shows maybe a camera, for example, or not a camera. So let's see the input is a selfie. Okay, so camera. So you want like a camera, a take picture button, and the take picture now is the primary action. Take picture. Obviously you don't want to have like a text label like this. You'll actually want a real camera button, but again, this is this is all wireframe. I have not had a designer go over it. So take picture. You'll also want a back button. Boom. And this will, this is a camera. So you'll see your face. Great. Big smile. And so on this page, the primary action is taking a picture. The secondary action is hitting a knee back arrow. That's a good thing about this. Once you take a picture, get the scan. You're going to enter your info blah blah. You have like ideally a good thing to do. You don't always have to do this, but putting one input field per page makes it very simple. Like onboarding flows, for example, it's one question per page generally. Sometimes they put multiple. Like if things fit together, sometimes age, sorry, sometimes weight and height is put together because that that is that flows and is typically seen as something together. It's also proportional. They affect each other. But then if you're going to ask unrelated questions and a row, it's always smoother to just separate the screens to keep one primary action per screen. So once you take the picture, go through all the questions that you'll design. The homepage will look something like this. Five actions left for the day. You'll have all your actions. And then you'll probably want something at the bottom where it's like new scan or like I honestly would put like a picture frame here. This is a picture of you when you scan. You'll be like last scan, 9-21, like some date. And then I'm honestly modeling this kind of after Kelly. Right now it can be anything but last scan, overall score, 99, add 100. And then maybe then like a few more bottomer like open. Lucky this is pretty shitty. It can fire frame and this is a wire frame. Okay. But maybe you want all your scans and then like I honestly so I would think you don't like scans section here. So you have your recommendation section, your scan section and you'll want a new scan button. Honestly how this is all laid out may not be optimal. You might want the new scan above your previous scan. You might want a list of like all of your past scans. That's a little bit more unclear. You might want the scans above the actions that honestly could work too. I can see how that could look good. But you want a new scan button. So on this page, the primary actions, although there's not necessarily one clear button, the primary action is to clear these actions. Maybe it's like maybe these are check boxes. You're just ticking them off. I don't like the auto layout stuff that Blake did. I'm not good at this stuff. So what you should learn it though. It's a good thing if you do something that I'm bad at. So it's not dry. But whatever you have like check boxes, you could check off the actions as you complete them. And technically if you want to really break down the hierarchy of things, the top action, this would be the primary action. This would be the secondary action to reshare you blah blah blah. And then new scan is like whatever the next after all of those. So the user comes on and they do that. Let's look at more examples of when you design how to think about the primary and secondary actions. So let's open up actually Cal AI in the design here. So in Cal AI, this is the main homepage. And the primary action, can you guess what it is? Primary action is clicking the plus. And it's a little bit less clear here that this is the primary action because there's so much going on on the screen. You see your calories left. You see a calendar at the top. You see a bar at the bottom with different pages. You see a recently uploaded section. The way you know it's the primary action and the way we show users that it is to make it easier is that we say you haven't uploaded any food and we have an arrow pointing to this big black button in the corner with a plus. This entire section is just dedicated to someone clicking on the black button. So that's how we kind of solve for so much going on on the screen. Then they hit the plus. Once they do it once the learn that that is it's all of this design really is most important for when a user first uses your app because you want it to be so easy. They don't need a manual. They don't need a god to use it. Video games, the first video games ever invented. You actually needed to read an entire manual in order to play them, which sucked obviously. That was way too much friction for most consumers who care enough to want to learn and play the game. For apps we want to make sure you do not need any instructions. You don't need any manual. It should be so easy, so intuitive, so simple that they just jump in and know exactly where to go. So you hit the plus. That's the primary action. There are a ton of other secondary actions like the pages clicking into this clicking past days in the calendar. And how I would think about designing your app is the primary action by far as what matters, especially for launch. When we launched KLAI, actually let me try to see if I can find this picture. But when we launched KLAI, it had one feature on it. Trying to find it right now. Actually, oh here it is. Suck. Okay. So Blake made this tweet. This was KLAI version 0.0. This is what we launched with. We literally launched with just the primary action. Take a picture of your meal. You hit the plus. It will take you to a camera. Snap the picture. Takes you back to the home screen. We'll load and show you the calories. That was it. There are no secondary actions here. But only other action there even is is clicking the calendar to go back to yesterday. That was the only other action even possible. And this worked for us. This was with this design we did $30,000 that month. And so in the second month, we did $150,000. And I think we were actually still in this design. Maybe a little bit more built out. But it was still very poor. So that should show you that you don't need to overthink things. You don't need to have too many features. The primary action is truly all that really matters right away. But you do want secondary actions to really build out the content of the app. This is kind of where more of retention comes in. Like obviously if they're downloading their app, your app, they're doing it because of your primary action. And that's what all your marketing is around. The secondary actions should kind of help the primary action. So for example, Cali. We're not just going to put random secondary actions. Like it would be if the primary action was track your calories, track your food. And then the secondary action was create a workout plan. That's somewhat related. But it's not close enough where it really, it's not close enough where it's intuitive. Instead, what we have is when you hit the plus, you're prompted with a few things. So you could scan food, log food from the database, log food from your save foods. And you also can long an exercise. All of this is related to calories. Basically, you could say the core action is log either calories eaten or calories burned because that's all this is. There's logging calories. You're either logging the food you ate or you're logging calories you've earned. We didn't have log exercise early on in Cali. We just had log food. And logging exercise that is a secondary action that benefits the user and helps because it helps them track their calories more accurately. That's how really I would look at secondary actions is that they are just supporting to the primary action, support a supporting role. Make sure that you don't put too much into your into your designs and screens. That was a big innovation we made going from Cali to my fitness belt was just simplifying the entire app. I'm actually going to find something right now that I have basically Cali. One of the best things about us that most people don't talk about is just how we made ourselves so easy to use. Look at this. So it's pretty blurry. I just pulled this from Forbes article about us. So it'll flex right there. You have Cali. It's actually crazy. You could build an app. An app idea can just come out of your mind and boom your informs a few months later. This could be you next. So Cali, you can see on the left and you can see all the other ones even though they're super blurry next to it. So my fitness pal look at everything going on. This is Cali. You can see everything fits in one page. My fitness pal it's already cut off. You have to scroll. There's so much more content. There are four different tabs here. There are these things underneath for steps and exercise. Your weight grabs you. Just so much shoved into one page. The core action is searching food. But then they put so many secondary actions that the app is so hard to understand. It's unintuitive. You need a manual. You need someone helping you. Legitimately, when you download my fitness pal, you need a friend telling you how to really onboard to it. There's a lot of friction. There are some other apps here and I don't really know their names for all of them. But you could see they all also have a ton going on. So much. It's confusing. When you look at a screen that you should instantly know what is the button I click to perform the desired action. With my fitness pal to be honest, it's very confusing to just know how to track your calories properly and all of these other apps as well. Cali, you could see weight easier and obviously I'm biased but like you could see this with your own eyes. It's fucking clear. So primary action right here clearly you could see it is hitting the plus. With my fitness pal, it's a little bit less clear but you can see it's searching for food. The reason this is not great is because primary actions a search bar is usually not a primary action. That's a little bit unintuitive. People are used to hitting a button, not hitting a search bar. But it's a search for food after like it's easy enough where you look at it the first time and then you're like okay that's how I do it. But then with everything else going on it's just so much. It takes the user wild to even see the search bar there. It's confusing. A jumble, a mess. Here this is honestly a lot less clear. There's an orange plus at the bottom. It's very small but and so much going on here you even see it take the quiz button. If I'm looking at this I kind of think that the take the quiz might even be the call to action. That might be the primary action because it's the biggest button on the screen and it's bright orange. So to me that's calling out to me which obviously it's wrong taking a quiz shouldn't be the core action. It's logging your food. This app a little bit better because the button is bigger at the bottom I think it's the biggest break green button in the app. So more clear but still a ton going on. It's not super not super obvious. Life sum it does better for sure. It's a lot more simple. They are much more intuitive and easy to understand. However they too are a little bit convoluted. You can see you have to scroll down to see all of the content on the page. I see four plus buttons on this app. So I'm confused. Okay am I supposed to click the green one at the bottom or am I supposed to click the one on the side here. But overall they're probably better. Then they're better than the other ones besides Kalei. Kalei is the best. So going back and talking about your design. I would think about orienting everything around the primary action. Making it very clear on every single page. Not just the homepage but every single page with the main button is and then you could have secondary buttons but they should always be de-emphasized. So if you're going to have two buttons for example a take picture button or if you want the option that less people do but you want to offer it be upload a picture. Then what you do is you just you put the button somewhere but you make it less less big less flashy. Put it underneath. If I'm looking at this it's clear. The core action is take a picture. Segmentary action is upload both are an option but more people will gravitate towards take a picture. If alternatively you want people to take more and upload less then you just flip them. Put one upload and then take at the bottom and consumer psychology will tell you that this will just cause more people to click the bigger the bigger more flashy button. Nine times out of time. Sick. Not much more for me to say on this. I think I really exhausted the terms primary and secondary actions. Something I do want to say though for your design. Just keep in mind that all of this can be iterated on it. All of this can be changed. Don't be a perfectionist. Just launch. Going back to the version of Cali we initially launched with. It was fucking embarrassing. If you're not embarrassed with what you're launching with then you launch too late. That's a quote. It's not necessarily always the case but I think generally it's a good framework you should launch earlier than you think. You don't need to have everything perfect but you need to have most importantly the core action. And it's also something in business just in general is that users are coming to your app for the one main action and the secondary actions aren't going to get them to leave. They're not going to get them to stay unless you overdo them. You yeah you really just should not have that. You don't want too many features in your app. You own one core feature and then you want some supporting features to the core feature but you not want all these random things baked in. Keep your app simple. Don't be the one stop shop for mediocre products. Instead be the single store shop for great products. Everyone asks why we don't put workout plans into Cali. And the answer is because it's going to convolut the app too much. There's going to be way too much going on. Sure people who track their calories probably want to work out as well and want workout plans. A good percentage of them but I would prefer to build a whole separate app under the same umbrella company that is all about fitness and we could even have a link in Cali to go download that app. But including them together is too much going on. That's the point of the app store. That's why we have multiple apps on our phones. I think each app should serve a very specific purpose. One app for track and calories, one app for working out. If you combine both then it's mediocre on both fronts. It gets convoluted confusing and it's just not what's intended by the fact that we literally have two. You could have multiple apps on your phones. For a reason, also you're missing out on additional revenue because you could charge two subscriptions. Two for different apps. That is actually more new ones because like some people say, okay, I want to build a super app for everything. You just charge a higher price. But we don't want to do that. We want to be simple, intuitive straight to the point and pump and print fucking cash. We're not the next reach out. Okay, I'm going to end this section here and see you guys in one of the later ones. Good luck.

### Transcript

Hey everyone, welcome back to the design module. Today we'll be going through onboarding and paywalls. These are probably the most essential parts of your app for being successful long-term because if you're onboarding sucks your conversion rate is going to be super low and if you convert your super low you won't be profitable and you won't be able to scale and be successful. So like what is an onboarding? Why can't I just skip to the paywall straight away? Explain that of course of course of course. So people objectively and objectively don't want to spend money if they don't have to. So you need to communicate value across to the user otherwise they'll just reject it and swipe up uninstall boom your user's gone. So the way we found best to communicate that value across is through quiz. It's a multi-choice quiz where you ask a user a bunch of personal questions and they answer it based on their personal life. So for example and we'll pull up the very old quitter onboarding the design has been upgraded immensely but like the content is relatively the same. So yeah if we look at the quitter onboarding you can see us a bunch of personal questions and you can see it on the screen now and get inspired on how to tailor this down to your niche but everything is super direct and you know the more user answers these questions the more they feel like the apps being built around them and their life and if like they feel like you resonate with them and their goals all extremely intentional. And you can do the same thing for color tracking it's like what is your way? How long have you been trying to lose way? What has stopped you in the past? Like what could help you moving forward? And then born, born, born you're answering these questions for them people inputting their personal information and they're like okay does app hears me? It understands me it understands my situation and this is essential because usually every product you are going to create has a pain point that you solve and so if you show them that you understand and that you have the magic solution they'll be like holy shit I'm going to just pay for it but that comes at the end but yeah that's the question now so you skip past the question now you asked our name and age we use this for like data and stuff we also use your name very attention and later to like make it feel more personal and I'll show you how we do that too so then we calculate the calculate actually does nothing but what it does is adds more time that you spend in the onboarding because if you've completed it you're intent super high now I'm going to tell you a little analogy before we continue like the longer user spends in the onboarding the better because if it's super simple to just click off and uninstall the app and save 30 bucks a year then I'll do it but if I've spent a lot a lot a lot of time building my profile and setting this app up for me and it's towards my goals then I'm more convinced to just pay and fuck you I'm just gonna do it rather than get nothing back for all the time I spent this is the typical gambler's phenomenon gamblers don't necessarily they're not as necessarily addicted to gambling they're just addicted to getting something back for all the time they spent gambling at least someone told me that it sounds legit there take my word for it okay so anyways we do an analysis and we say look we have some news to break to you you are addicted you have a problem you need this app quit up you need it but let's check your symptoms first like this let's verify this information and this check your symptoms but so one this screen scares you and two it nudges you into the next screen and every subsequent screen yes adds friction but it also increases your intent to buy so it's all very important so then we go to symptoms and you know you can have different things with different apps for quitter it's like you know one of the porn side effects for like calorie tracking it's like what the side effects of you being fat or you eating you know unhealthy food and it could be the it could be the exact same stuff like I'm eating junk food and I feel unmotivated I have no ambition I have difficulty concentrating etc etc but the goal of this screen and I'll show you very soon is to compare these negative symptoms to an eventual positive outcome if you buy the subscription so it's like okay we scare you with all these words like you you're like getting weak erections and then we flash after you finish this we flash up a red screen porn is a drug porn destroys relationship porn shatters sex drive and are you feeling unhappy a lot of people feel unhappy so like this screen is kind of triggered kind of nothing but what was it down to porn it's like all the problems in your life it's fucking porn you need to quit but you probably can't quit that's why you downloaded this app and then born welcome to quitter this is your path to recovery rewire your brain back to normal stay motivated and avoid setbacks don't go back to that bad life we are unmotivated we're getting weak erections and conquer yourself be a fucking man like rise to the occasion just be the best version of yourself and level up to life so this is a very intentional juxtaposition we compared a super negative cloud of stuff where you've answered personal questions about your life and all of these are like like not negative but like they are negative they are towards the the pain point that you're solving with your app so for example quitter porn all these are porn related so super negative you're feeling bad about yourself like I've been addicted I mean but sorry as well you're also learning about yourself when I ask you these questions you're learning about yourself you're learning down I've been addicted since I was fucking 12 this needs to stop this is insane and am I getting do I need to watch more extreme material like fuck this is ruining my mind so you're learning about yourself you're then getting scared by the symptoms then getting scared by the language we're using saying it's porn is the worst thing ever and then boom path to recovery you're in the right place quitter we are here for you we loved you and like we're gonna help you rely your brain help you stay motivated etc etc so that contrast is very uplifting for people which is also why we have a super high conversion rate you heard it from the man himself and then we give social proof so rewiring benefits and people are talking about the app so let's say these all NPCs they aren't real we probably should have real people but Jack says he's he's feel like a different person he's way more talk to and aware so and then Michael he wants to go out he wants to work out he wants to live he wants to be a fucking man he wants to he wants to conquer the world plona who's my co-founder obviously has been very addicted he wrote this one personally quitting as an army to change my mindset on the little things in life i was coming to grips with the fact that life is dark boring depressing and then i die screw that quitting has allowed me to change my mindset on the little things in life and yeah like you get the point so personal question there calculate the result scare you uplift you social proof and then we give the chart we show okay like you could quit on your own but look at quitter look how much faster you can quit and whoa how is this guy here right now it's interesting anyways you can see that you can see that by week free you're going to go through the same bullshit cycle but with quitter you're gonna win you're gonna rise to the occasion you're gonna finally beat the addiction and then we get into like the more uplifting part of things like choose your goals i want to be strong i want to have stronger relationships i want to have improved self confidence and then do you have a referral code this is useful if you want to track which influences sent you to what place what influences suggested you're up and actually downloaded it like what the fuck this is important for you to track which influences brought in your traffic there we go then give us a reading this is probably one of the most essential screens as well not everyone is gonna rate you five stars straight out the game out trying your app but they will obviously be like the 0.5% of people that actually do and when you have a million downloads 0.5% is a hell of a lot of people that give you a five star review so i totally recommend this screen i will say as well the more five star of ratings you have on the app store the more people trust you and all the more the more people actually end up getting to the end of your onboarding whereas if you're a brand new app and you have like 20 reviews people don't trust you like they don't trust you they're gonna be hesitant they're gonna be more reluctant to not they're gonna be more reluctant to pay than if you had 50,000 five stars and it's like 20 bucks but like 50,000 people rate this five stars hell yeah like sign me up and then this is one thing we do quitter that i've seen a lot of people not be able to do or not done i'm losing my mind but like i hope you guys hear me through this hear me through this this is fucking source right here right so we say welcome to quitter your path to freedom here's your card it's decided to help you quit porn forever now this is the most fucking this is the most forward thing i've ever done but it's low key working now it's time to invest in yourself and like short it's a bit pushy and it's a bit like like uh it's in the uncanny value territory but instead of people spamming me with reviews saying i thought this app was gonna be free i don't know i was gonna be paid or even is it paid a lot of people don't even know if they have to pay they don't want to pay they think there's a free version but the fact it says now it's time to invest in yourself they're like okay it's time to lock in and even though it's like they're reading it on a screen and it's not like this is inhuman like there's no one there's not your friend isn't telling you to invest in yourself which has a really high like conversion rate the fact you're reading on a screen will sit in the back of your mind and when you do get to the paywall you remember that sentence it's four forty five bucks a year but now it's time to invest in myself i would spend that shit on big max but now it's time to invest in yourself start my journey pay boom you're in and that's a really really really good funnel this is one of the best funnels ever i can pull up my revenue for for the day oh we're gonna get into paywalls at a sec i can pull up my revenue for the day this is proceeds after apple's fighting is cut but fuck that don't even look at that just look at the conversion rate like this is pretty good um 16 my actually fucking it's good but it's it's it's it's usually better it's usually like 20% so like one in six people are paying this isn't a free trial field this is one in six people paying so yeah that is onboarding for you guys peace out all right boys so i would usually explain how to design a good onboarding but for all of my future apps if i do create future apps i'm just gonna be repping this exact format but just re-wording it and you know i'm just gonna recommend you guys do the same um cal ai has a very similar onboarding to quitter literally almost exactly the same format and you know you guys can design this rectangle text text for question etc like this is this is like one screen very simple it's right out in front of you say with these these are just lotty files so if you search through google lotty files you'll find a bunch and then search within lotty files what you like so maybe uh search star and you might find this one or sun or meditate you'll find this one or lock you'll find this one etc um this is a very well designed onboarding i wouldn't really met the will and like we like me and cal ai we've made millions of dollars with this exact format so i'm not gonna teach you how to design it but i will link this in the uh the course but yeah now let's get to the paywall so this is a paywall that i started with which is just a simulator of all the screens kind of laid out so you can kind of get intro of such preview of the app before you pay at the top we have very intentional texts saying get unlimited access to quitter including personalize the science based custom plan adult content blocker community chat through tracking daily pledges plus much more um and you know what this is great and you can copy this if you go to supool you click into templates and you scroll down a little bit and you will find the here we go the quitter quitter paywall right here so what you do on supool is you click onto this and you click use template and i wouldn't generally recommend you go into the game and start designing your own one and i know it's counterintuitive because this is a design course but i can show you what good design is without having you design it yourself so when it comes to consumer utility you usually want to display all the benefits up front so something like something like something like homework AI is actually pretty good um you can see unlock all features of pro you're kind of explaining the core features remember the onboarding has already sold your app people are convinced now just summarize the core features and make it super easy to pay and i'm going to show you my current onboarding the one that's doing the best and we hired a design to do this but you can see it's pretty simple again still the very core features that people are paying and buying into you also have the previews of the app so very similar to the first iteration that suit that quitter launch with but just in a different format you see this time it's in a scroly carousel and then also you can just change the plan so if i don't want to pay 29 19 year why don't i just pay 15 a month and people do do that so interesting though we also on this iteration show the reviews so this is a very interesting point um and you know designing this in figma i can definitely show you how to do it but i think it might be a better use of my time to just show you what good design is show you the core principles and then you can apply this yourself blake has already covered a lot of app design um and i'm not the best at pigma i used to go off the ball but i have a lot of insight so yeah this is a very good payal as well i believe they have something very similar in their templates and i would just use templates because up to your first like 100k even 500k i think we didn't even change the quitter payal until maybe one and a half million dollars in revenue so it's not as important as you think it might have slight maybe two to three to four to five percent increases but just don't over index on perfecting it per se so like okay if i want to do a calorie checking out i'll show you what's the good one because we've already done the calorie checking tutorial actually that comes next i'll show you guys in the development module but like if i wanted to choose a calorie tracking payal i would pick hmm this is a great one for you say i obviously not for calorie checking this is so bad this is zest duh duh duh duh actually this is the cal ai i want so yeah and it has the gif so i would use this i would have we want you to try cal ai for free i would have a moving gif of the app and you can record this in screen studio i believe that's the name of the app screen studio um and just run through it and then obviously link this to your product we cover this in the development module so make sure you watch that next and this is a solid design um and then with super i'll show you real quick how you can actually change things around and personalize it for you so unlock cal ai unlock cal ai there you go so we just change text super simple no commitment canceling time this is great and then we go into products we change products of 499 a week and then the second year in land 19 and a month and as you can see bomb this is a solid payal and then for the video for the video we get to upload a video do i have any videos of the app actually you know what we do we do we do we do we do so this is the app i'm building for you guys you'll see it later in the development module but i'm just gonna screen report it so i'm gonna do command art run you through it bomb bomb and you can't see the actual app because this is just the onboarding but i will upload it ready let's see yeah you gotta get off you gotta get off and you gotta teach me to get off i'm recording recording yeah what up gang someone doesn't know where the group chats well you you opened it so at that point i think i play all studying uh yeah listen this kids gotta go fucking party right now we don't want to a bit us we did to this paywall that made it double the conversions going it's that the privacy it used to be spelled privacy policy but just make it privacy double the hour for the details that Matt this is a complete joke it was actually you know uh deceiving the consumer that i hate all this can you guys a scam guys no but what you want to do here is you see it says try for zero and then they click it and it's a multi page i don't know this is an us did you create this this is a template bro yeah yeah it's well created template out of us yeah they've done it so i'll try and we're gonna continue they fucking stop multi page is actually great guys saying to the user will send your reminder before you free trial ends they fucking love that is that true love it's true we do send an notification it would be very fucked up you say you will but then you do not if i if we actually did an 80 test and it did decrease the conversion rate slightly but you need to actually set like it would be really fucked up not to yeah true yeah so we tell them what it would like you zero days that's like i'm gonna stop yeah that's gonna get yeah yeah she started for trial and um there we go you got on that's the source guys tell you get on that's on boarding and peels done now we're gonna go fucking party let's go out tonight let's fucking go see boys

Hey everyone, welcome back to the design module and today we're going to be talking about brand aesthetic. Now this is personally my favorite thing to do when I start walking on a new app or a new project. It like a brand brings a business to life and so I usually always start with that. Counterintuitively we started this design module with wire framing and I suppose that's how like most people do things. But for me it's always about brand first. So I'd love to do this little deep dive into what makes Quitter so good and successful in its own niche. How to build an app for your niche and how to get inspired by other brands that you like. So let's start. The most important thing to know is that you need your brand to resonate with your target demographic. You can't just build something that you think is cool if it doesn't appeal to the people you are targeting. For example, U-Bo they have a great and very clean UI. It's a bit like Snapchat, yellow, it's colourful, it's popping. But like this doesn't feel very professional. This doesn't feel very serious. This feels a bit like a joke or a school project which is great when just targeting Gen Z or younger individuals which they do. But let's say this is an app to find a lawyer. Lawyer and law is a very serious topic. And so these bright colours and these lower case lettering and these big fonts etc. And these emojis specifically as well. It isn't professional. No one's going to take you seriously if you're trying to be a lawyer app. Trying to find the plural version of that but I can't. So yeah, there's another example. So if I want to build a calorie tracking app for everyone, I'm going to use very simple colours. And I'm not going to pull any demographic in one way. And it's going to be like all inclusive. So it's hard to really like explain what I mean by that. But KAI shows no humans. It shows no faces. As soon as they do that, they're pushing a demographic onto you. Whereas with UBO you can see young people or at least relatively young will make this bigger for the sake of the video. You can see relatively young people. These are all under like 25 years old and like mostly females. Actually almost everyone's a female funny enough. So that's pushing that app towards a certain demographic. Whereas for a calorie tracking app, they're not showing any humans. So anyone that's watching it feels like this could be for them. They're not influenced by other factors like an image of a human. That is older or there's you know, got a family or kids, whatever. Very important when it comes to appealing to your niche. Next we have Quitter. And like why is Quitter successful? So we targeted Gen Z and younger people specifically. And the traditional Quitting Point Apps weren't cool. They put you in a box. They made you feel like you had this serious issue. They had like these intensive programs. They were showing pictures of older men and I'll show you in a second what I mean. And it didn't really appeal to younger people. So they were underserved and they had nowhere to go. And they just suffered with this addiction. Pretty much the entire time they had no solutions. And so look at our competitor now. So this is a really bad competitor. And straight away you can tell there's a massive difference. This feels super engaging. This feels really cool and this makes me want to down at the app. As a young guy I see a lot of colors. I see orbs. I see streaks. I see a gamified way to quit. I'm like hell fucking yeah. Whereas here I see an old guy maybe in his like 30s mid 30s. This is Quitter Point and masturbation. That language itself is a bit vulgar and like it's just a bit cringe. Whereas with us we just make it like simple. Just quit porn now. Just quit porn for life. Like instead of quit porn and masturbation like come on bro. No one's gonna, no one really appeals to that. Next track time and money saved. This doesn't really appeal to Gen Z. I don't think Gen Z is spending money on porn. They're just like watching it for free. So this is completely missing the mark when it comes to the younger demographic. But as you can see they still have 400 ratings. So whatever niche and what sorry whatever demographic they are targeting is working. But you know the most important thing to pull from this. It doesn't feel cool. It feels like a chore. And you know no young person. You're never gonna see a young person using this for sure not. And like we'll get right into the details like the data doesn't fly. Most of our downloads come from under 18 year olds. Now sure not everyone has a credit card to pay and actually use our app. But most of the traffic comes from people that are under 18. So whatever messaging we're doing is working. And I bet if we compare the data to this and of course it's not open source so we can't confirm. But I bet no one under like 25 is downloading this. But yeah that's like the whole point with niches and brand aesthetics. Like maybe quitter won't appeal to older people because they're like what the fuck is this. I want something actually serious and tangible. This feels like an actual program. This feels like yeah like a program pretty much. Whereas this is like this feels like a game. So super important to know when it comes to brand aesthetics like understand your demographic. Understand who you are targeting because if you get the messaging wrong. You're not going to succeed in who you're targeting. But you won't target the right people. So yeah I'm going to show you how to build a brand and how I would start building a brand based on the example design. Which is a testosterone max app. Now there are obviously two ways to spend this. So I'm targeting older gym guys who are like in their 30s who take steroids that want to be super super test testosterone to the max. I never use this like so my my apologies. But they want to be tested to the max. They want to be fucking ripped. They want to be super masculine etc etc. So that is one way one demographic that we can target. The other is just young people that listen to Andrew Tate for example. And they're like oh I want to get my testosterone up. I think that would be really cool. I would attract girls. So I'm going to show you two versions of how I would build this for an older demographic and for younger demographic. So one of the core principles when it comes to younger is use things that are relatable. One of those things could be emojis. So as you can see I'm probably going to start this with an emoji. Now there are a few apps that do this. Is it super professional? No but that's the point. You're targeting a bar younger demographic. So this is it's just less important. So here's the emoji we're going to use actually make it a little bit smaller. There we go. And then I'm going to change this background to be yeah that feels or maybe like a slated gray. Pick that. And then maybe I have text saying test max. Max is a very new age word so it works for the younger demographic. And we'll just do inter that's fine. And I'll make this about 300 maybe 225. Cool. And then I'll give it a stroke. A black stroke will make it a bit larger maybe 10. There we go. We'll just make this stroke green. Or we make the text green and stroke black. Straight black. Text green. Yeah. This is honestly solid. Now of course you can say from a design standpoint this isn't very clean. But it is definitely polarizing and you need to be capturing young people's attention. So this would low key actually work. Maybe the stroke makes it look unprofessional. Maybe I just do a drop shadow instead. 100. Maybe a black stroke slightly. 5. Okay that low key works. So again lots super professional we can make another version of this as well. Probably without chart as the main. We'll center this make it about 350. And then the spacing between I believe that is this way. Minus 50. Oh shit. What about vertical scaling though? You know what is fine I guess for now. I don't know how to use thing that well. But this could work. As a younger demographic or for a younger demographic this could totally, totally work. It seems really stupid but you get the vibe I'm trying to go for. Now let me show you how to build a very serious older demographic. Oh okay let me show you how to build a brine aesthetic for an older demographic based on the same app idea. So this is going to be feeling a little bit more professional. And maybe we get like a syringe or some all test. Like something like I can't have emojis can I? I also wouldn't put text in. Let me think. Yeah like I would probably do something like this. Honestly. This feels more legit. All the older guys will know exactly what this means. So we'll just make this a bit smaller. Maybe just TM. Alright. And that's in the center. And then we'll just lower the opacity of this by like 50%. Maybe even more. There we go. Loki this feels more professional and this feels more like a school project. And that's how I would design the TM. Alright everyone so now I'm going to show you how I would design the brine aesthetics for the two different demographics of the test, austro and maxing app. So I already started this a little bit but for the older demographic we wanted to film a professional and more serious and more like get shit done. Because that's like these older guys motto is like I'm fueled with testosterone, I'm jacked, I'm rips, I'm massive, I'm scary and I want to scare you in the process. So all of these massive fonts and like like bolded text and all caps very intentional. It literally appeals to that demographic so much that that like okay holy shit like this is for me. Even the app icon like it isn't that engaging but if you know you know and these big testosterone heads they know that this symbol behind signifies testosterone. So they're like okay whoever made this up knows what they're doing and this feels again very serious and very legit. Whereas like if we want to target a younger demographic maybe they're not they don't really care as much but they want to test it out and they want to do it in a fun way. They don't want to destroy the competition like we say here. They maybe you want to subtly increase the testosterone playing if you're not playing if you're games but like they want to increase their testosterone in a gamified way. They want to have fun like the young people at the end of the day they don't want to go all in. So for the younger demographic we choose emojis and this is because emojis are very relatable and yeah young people use them a lot. So it makes sense to leverage that kind of cultural significance within our app icon and our branding. So look at the look at the difference here. Test max become manually. It's way more passive it's way more you know it's easier to be a part of and then the line is like get jacked with easy steps. Young people want to cut corners they don't really want to go all in. So this makes more sense to them and a gamified way to increase testosterone. Again super super passive but it also explains what the app does. So young people will be like okay you know this I see the emoji I see the green font. This seems like everything I want to achieve out of getting testosterone I'm going to try it. Whereas like if I was an old guy and I saw this I'd be like okay like I bought too much fucking testosterone to wait around and get jacked of easy steps. I want to go fucking hard. So when they read this become the ultimate you destroy the competition. This is the one they will download and this is the one they'll pay for. This feels like a school project but low key if you are targeting a young demographic that's what you want. Of course this is a little bit difficult because we're talking about testosterone maxing out and like our young people super interested in that. Not sure if this was a social app again this would be really easy to sell to with the emojis and big fonts etc. So a thing to note is... So just to reiterate the most important thing about brand is how much you appeal to whatever demographic you're targeting. And so you need to get these things right. And my best advice when it comes to designing a brand and designing a product that you end up selling and making money from and building a brand from is just be the consumer yourself. For example, Zach, well actually I'm going to use me as an example but I don't want to say it's not like I'm fucking joker every day I'm just saying like I'm going to use me as an example. I went down self-improvement and you know quitting porn is a part of that. The reason it's so difficult in self-improvement is because it's so accessible the algorithms are filled with this like soft core porn material because that gets the most engagement. And so anyone that's trying to quit kind of just battles of themselves there's no like real good solution. So I was like okay what if I made it fun I made it cutting edge and I made it cool to actually begin quitting. So I was that person so I knew exactly what I would pay for and what I would use so I just built it. Now of course this isn't like super tangible advice because you could be the demographic and it could still like the brand said it could still suck. But the most important things to know are if it's for younger people just try and make it a bit more cool and a little bit more relaxed and laid back and if it's for older people kind of just make it seem more professional more serious and more more like a program. And it could be more boring as well. And so yeah another big advice. And you know what I'll close this by saying anything you do when it comes to your color scheme your font sizes and your language don't switch it up at all throughout your app. Make sure your brand is cohesive and this representing itself in almost everything you do. As soon as you start mixing fonts together you lose that brand aura. Now it is fine if the font isn't completely the same like maybe I want to do this Canada. I think this is low key fine but any more than three different fonts it won't work. It just feels sloppy. And brands gain respect because you feel the time the dedication the messaging throughout it. Quitter is such a strong brand because we've been here around for a year we've put a bunch of cool stunts or on a mission to take down the point industry. The UI is super fucking clean the app works really well and that's how we bought our brand. And if we started using these brand of different colors and like didn't represent the brand as true to itself and always try to do different shit and it's hard to explain what I mean by that. But stick to your core messaging and don't switch it up. Actually I can give a great example and this is so off topic but it kind of works. This is my profile picture. It's me looking up the sky blue background from a year ago. This is bought a brand. I bought a brand in myself by repping this profile picture. As soon as I change my profile picture I'm going to need to build my brand again. Now of course it's going to be easier because I'm using the Alex later name but it's generally generally a bad strategy to switch up branding. And like even Quitter Quitter's logo has not changed since the beginning. And so one of my greatest advice is just stick to what you have as long as you're happy with it of course and keep growing that. Don't change things around. You can change the app source screen shots they aren't really that important but the language, the fonts, the logo try to keep that uniform for everything you do. And so like if I went into this app maybe I would copy the font that I just used from my super serious version. So what font is this? Can it. So go into this and instead of in sir we use can it. There you go. Maybe we want to make this all caps. Facial analysis. There we go. And then we'll have the logo TM. We'll copy this. TM or test dough. Or maybe we want this to be the kind of one which also works. So having a different font for the logo and a different font for the test for the text works well too. We see this with Instagram, we see this with Twitter etc etc. And that's how you build a brand. 101 how you build a brand. But yeah. I'm going to move this down a copy just so you guys are aware. But yeah. Peace out boys.

Let's talk about some viral design. How are we going to make your shitty app designs actually look good in an influencer video so that it converts and it goes viral? It's not overly complicated. It's not overly complicated. It's kind of about branding your own app. What I mean by this, let me just break this down. If you have an influencer talk about your app, if you have a paid ad talk about your app, if you have, if you're making UGC content and they're showing your app, you need people to know it's your app. There's so many videos where people show apps and the video blows up. But then everyone's asking in the comments, what app is that? And no one fucking knows. And you're not going in in the comments and responding. So it doesn't actually work or it no one finds out and then it doesn't convert. And by the way, let me be honest by saying or go back and say, you want people commenting what app is that? That's a very good sign. But just people should be able to figure it out if they looked hard enough in the video. People are always going to comment what app is that because consumers are generally not smart. And so they'll see something they're lazy. They'll just comment instead of doing their like hard work themselves. But influencers show your app on screen. How are people going to know it's your app? A few ways. One, let's see what we do in Cali. In Cali, we have the name Cali Big at the top of the app screen on the home page. So if an influencer shows it, boom, right there. We also do the same thing on the scanning page. It's actually not updated here. This is an old version. But we replace scanner with big text that's as Cal AI on influencers. Actually, something interesting that we did is I didn't like always having Cali and branding it for regular users. Because I thought it was low-key low quality to just put names on everything. For example, I'm someone who doesn't wear clothing with labels typically, or brand names typically. And so I feel the same way about apps. So we have two separate versions of the app. One for the creator and one for users. The one for the creator has the big Cali right here. Very big. Because this is the screen everyone's showing off. It's the scan screen, the core traction. And so we need it there. When the influencer shows it, we want people to know in big that it is Cal AI. And for users, we don't show that. We have it at the top on the home page, but we do not show it in the scanner. I'd say that's the main thing. Just making it super obvious from content, what your app is. And the best way to do that is literally by putting your name and putting your logo. Okay. How else can we make the design viral? People like visuals on social media. People want things to be cool. They want it to be aesthetic. If for Cal AI, we had, if the screens looked very first of all, okay. Saying a lot. This goes into the general design principles for everything, but you need it to be straightforward and simple. If you have too much going on, then if your app is shown in a frame of a video for like two seconds, and you have so much, no one will know what they're seeing. You need the app, the contents of the app to be very simple and concise, so that it's very obvious on a glance what's going on. They understand exactly the process of what's happening. Also, you do need cool visuals. So when things are happening, you want it to look nice. When you take a picture of food on Cal AI, you go, you take the picture. Not much we can do. It's just a camera. Then we show it analyzing. And we've basically created a three step flow for all influencers, where they will show taking a picture, show scanning. And then they'll go to the results page, and they'll show what the result is ultimately exploding right now. We require this for all influencers. And really all ad creatives in general. So they'll show the taking picture, the loading, and then this page. And this is actually an outdated version. This one is more recent. So you'll kind of want to think about your main flow, the main aha moment. You should call it that influencers should show off. I'm a believer every app, pretty much every app, 90%, 99%, even, has an aha moment. There, wherever your users realize that they're getting the value. For Cal AI, it's okay, you take a picture of your food, you get the calories. For Quitter, I think it's the first time it actually helps you, it stops you from your urges. And so I think the panic button is really the big thing. It's like the big core action that is like a viral action. It's flashy. It's in your face. And there are a bunch of other examples on this as well. So you'll want to come up with your aha moment, and then just make sure that that is branded well, so that when your influencers talk about it, or not just I know I keep saying influencers, but when the app is shown in some kind of ad, or some kind of marketing material, it is easy to understand from a glance, easy to understand what's going on to comprehend what the app does, to comprehend the value that they're receiving. Make sure it's in sequential order. And make sure that the name of your app and your logo is shown very clearly, so that people know where to go download it afterwards. These are the main principles to keep in mind. You should iterate, you should always change things, see how they affect conversion rate. And that's how we go from here. Good luck.

What's up everybody? This is Module 2, viral app design. My name is Hunter. A little bit of background on myself. I have been designing viral consumer apps since 2017. My apps have done over 300 million downloads. Currently have over 150 million monthly active users. I have generated over 100 million dollars in revenue across social, dating, lifestyle, fintech, many categories of apps. I've been in the game for eight years. I'm 26 now. I started when I was just high school. So if you're a young guy or a young girl watching this, I was at the beginning not too long ago. It's definitely an industry that you cut your teeth on and you call through the mud, but it's worth it. Today I'm really excited because I'm going to get to talk about my favorite part of building an app which is the design. We're not going to just have a figma how to. We're really going to talk about frameworks, key terms, methodologies, and really general mindset of how to build a viral app. I'm going to try to get you into that mindset and you can apply these lessons and these frameworks across your apps and your ideas in any niche. I'm going to talk about really what makes an app go viral and that's the first question. So what makes an app go viral? There's a number of things that make an app go viral. The way that I've broken it down is like this. There are emotional hugs and core human drivers. This is something called the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is something you know, concept and psychology. You have the bottom needs which are more basic and as you go up the pyramid you reach self-actualization and these are the highest level and these highest vibration needs. Apps that go viral are usually targeted one of these needs. So belongingness and love. That's a great example of there's a lot of apps that target that. You know, esteem needs, prestige, feeling of accomplishment. I would say an app like Duolingo, you know, where you're hitting streaks or Kaliai and you're logging your meals and you're maintaining your consistency. Safety needs could be, you know, other kinds of social apps, you know, social apps like gas from 2022. People wanted to know like, you know, am I, you know, do people think I'm cool? Do people think I'm nice? Do people think I'm funny? Right. NGL would follow that as well. You know, what do my friends think about me? You know, these are core human drivers and these are core human needs. I think Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a great thing to look at whenever you're building apps is always just remember that like this is why people do things. And I think it's really important to remember that. So when you're looking at your apps and you're looking at like, what is my app doing? What is it providing to people in terms of a core human driver and a core need? I would take a look at this and try to figure out where you plot on the pyramid, right? Because depending on where you are, it will inform things like you're onboarding, like how much user investment you want in the product prior to coming in. It will also inform like what, you know, what is the core action of the product? So I think this is an important thing to look at and something I've used for many years. So some examples of this, right? This is one of my apps that I co-founded and GL this did over 300 million downloads. The core human driver in this app is what do people think about me? Right? Everybody wants to know what their friends think about them, especially when there's no filter or you know, it's anonymous, right? So people want to know. And this is a very effective driver because people will jump through hoops and go down a complicated, somewhat complicated UX route in order to satisfy this drive. So that's NGL's core driver. Gas, another viral app from 2022, was really about who likes me? Gas was about sending anonymous compliments. So it was about who likes me, who thinks I have nice hair, who thinks I have nice eyes, who thinks that I'm a great person. And that's a fundamental need, right? Who likes me? So we have what do people think about me and who likes me? Then we have tea. This is a newer app. It's blown up. And this is really what are they saying about me? If I'm a guy, right? I want to know what they're saying about me because it's a women's only app or if I'm a girl, what are they saying about someone? This app is extremely effective at getting a core human need, right? Wanting to know what people are saying about you or somebody else really struck a core and that's why they went number one. Be real. I don't remember being real. The core human driver and be real. It was like you would open the app because you get a notification. Your friend posted. You wanted to see what your friend posted. Like that you wanted to see it. So you were willing to take a picture. So you know, what picture do my friend post? This is another really core human driver. All in all these apps, what number one on the app store? And that's why we talk about them. These are apps that went, you know, super viral, number one on the app store, millions and millions of downloads. So that's really what I look at when it comes to emotional hooks and core human drivers. The next thing we're going to talk about is K factor. So I wrote it out right here. It's super simple. It's the average number of new users, each user invites. Pretty simple, right? So I'm a believer that when you build a product, you should have the product really serve as the marketing as well. I like product led growth. So I love to encourage users to share. I love to get a certain percentage of users as many as possible to do specific actions to share or invite contacts, share an asset on social media. I really always like to aim for a K factor greater than one. This is a big part of my methodology. So I'm always thinking about how can we get a pile of users, bring them into the product, and then we know that at minimum, they're going to bring back everybody plus 10% or everybody plus 50% or in the case of an app like NGL, everybody, you know, times two, three, five. So K factor is extremely important and something to think about. And this is a term you're going to hear a lot across viral apps, not just in design across everything. Great. So this is a little story time. This was when NGL went number one in the app store, which was an awesome experience that was super, super grateful. This is really when I talk about K factor, you know, this is what I'm really talking about. This is the hourly downloads for NGL. So this was, you know, one of our one of our highest hours. And you see how just goes straight up. And this is what's called having really a high K factor when you go from a thousand downloads. And then this was about I think a week or so later, two weeks later, not even. And now we have a million users in the last 30 minutes. And, you know, I think it's really important. Use unique trackable links. Very, very important because you want to know where the growth is coming from. And I tell this to founders. So this, these are just some tips, right? You have to implement data, mix panel, amplitude, track every user event. Because we want to know what's going on in every facet of the app, because this is going to help us maximize K factor. So this is just an important tip. But when you have extraction, this is a little meme from what we've said to run at one of my companies that makes panel amplitude. These services, they want their money. So it's a, I guess, a good problem to have when it works. But yes, use unique trackable links. Make sure that, you know, I love using ref links for users of a big fan of that. So I can track everything and know which users coming from which user. I'm a big fan of that. Okay. So the next thing we're going to talk about is social proof. So cues showing the app's popularity and acceptance as socially normative. This loses your trust and engagement. The way that I see social proof is it really establishes comfort. At the end of the day, you want to see that other people are doing the thing that the app is asking you to do. For apps like NGL, social proof was critical to our success. The reason that the app succeeded is enough people saw their friends doing it. So then they decided to do it because it was socially normal. This can also be not just people posting links and participating in loops like NGL. This could be just having a lot of views on TikTok videos for your app. Having lots of people see your app, lots of eyeballs creates a sense of social proof and knowing that people know that this app does this thing. It's known and it's widely accepted and understood. Social proof really is kind of it's about enough users have comprehended the purpose of your app and expressed it, shared it, amplified it to the point where people don't feel weird for using it or posting it. And I think social proof is something that you just really always have to be thinking about because certain apps have different ways of implementing social proof. And we'll obviously talk about that. So I love to talk about the band Aladdin of that. Classic human behavior. We are more willing to like a video with more likes or more willing to engage with something that is perceived as more popular. Humans have a tendency to really like, as I say, arbitrary big numbers. They put a power into it. And it makes sense. It's the wisdom of the crowd. If the crowd has deemed this video or this piece of content or this app or whatever it is. If it's perceived as a lot of people using it, then somehow it's perceived as once again socially normative. Like we talked about up here with social proof. So bandwagon effect is super important. And a lot of apps, especially viral apps that are in consumer social, really thrive on creating bandwagon effect. And I think that I really work on creating with my apps is really getting everybody to do the same thing at the same time because everybody is doing it and they all hop on the bandwagon because they see everybody doing it. And it comes down to really knowing how to just activate that pocket of users to initiate the bandwagon effect. But when you're designing the apps, you really have to think about how do you get someone to hop on this bandwagon. How do you get them to join in with the fun. And that really comes down to social proof as a big thing there. Right. You want them to feel comfortable and confident to do the thing that you're asking them to do. So yeah, make people feel socially acceptable by sharing or inviting. Sharing should maintain or boost social capital. Totally agree with it. And I think certain apps cannot be shared like this. I'm really talking about some apps can be shared. Right. Some apps you can share, you know, your streak on dualingo. Right. You can share, you know, your, your NGL link. Right. You can share and someone sent you a compliment on gas. Right. You could, you know, you could share a tick-tock over iMessage to your friend. Right. Like there's, there's, you know, sharing shouldn't not decrease social capital. Right. So sharing dating app is pretty difficult. Right. That's a more difficult one getting someone to post that they're on a dating app. That's really difficult. Right. So, you always keep in mind like there is something about boosting social capital that's very important. And it, and it all comes back to, you know, comfort and security, which we talked about earlier with, you know, Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And then sharing on different platforms, right. There's different motivations. The things you share on Instagram are different than the things that you would share on Snapchat or the things you share on X. This is especially true when targeting younger users. Right. Most of my apps have been used in the core demo of, you know, 18 to 30. So really you have to look at what are people posting on their Instagram? What are they willing to post on their Instagram? You know, some things are better posted on Snapchat. You know, I had an app called Wink that I was a designer of, we did 70 million downloads. I built that with my first mentor who created musically. He was the president of the company. And we learned a lot in that app. That app used to, you know, I'm old, you know, growth loop on Instagram. And we worked on Snapchat really well because the app was to, you know, about making friends on Snapchat. And GL really worked on Instagram. You know, there had never been anonymous app that had been built on Instagram prior to, and GL, we were the first. And when we took off on Instagram, it then permeated to other platforms. Right. X, for example, I've launched things exclusively on X. My Fintech platform, DAIS, was exclusively on X. We used X as the primary driver of organic viral growth with sharing links similar to GL, sharing link. This time on X. The point of what I'm saying is that sharing on IG, sharing on Snap, sharing on X, all have different motivations. And there's a different quality filter. So I always like to think about what is postable on these platforms. And there's just something to think about, right. You won't post the same thing on X that you will post on Instagram or Snapchat or any other platform. Or you won't send the same things over text that you would post on your story. Right. So you have to understand the context in which your app can be shared in order to optimize for that virality. Great. So virality. Now we're going to talk about viral growth loops. This is a word I use a lot. This is a word I tweet a lot. This is where I say a lot. You're going to hear me say this a lot. The way that I summed it up is, you know, a viral growth loop is a self-sustaining cycle where a user's action triggers new users to join, which creates a hockey stick growth. Right. I showed earlier in the previous section on K factor examples of hockey stick growth. That growth came from a viral loop. So I also like to say if loops are strong enough, they will reengage users who have churned. Right. So if you can get people to share your app or share content from your app and push it out more and more, create UGC videos for your app, then ultimately users that have already encountered your app, will be brought in again through the net and reactivated. So that's something just to always consider with building these kinds of loops is yes, it's a self-sustaining growth of new users, but also it's bringing users in that have already churned because you're still getting those views. So if you're still having lots of users engage, you're still kind of the fly reel is still including the people that have churned. Keep that in mind. That's really one of the major things about viral loops that I like to think about is how do you make sure you reengage existing users. Right. So we'll talk more about that later of course. Right now I'm going to talk about explicit explicit loops. Right. So this is the NGL flow right here. We're going to walk through the flow and I'm going to explain exactly how it works and why I designed the way I did it. So this is the share asset. You can just post a link by itself, you know, and put any vote you want, but this is the main share asset that we direct people to post. We tried many different share assets. So we tried share assets that were very bright colored. We tried share assets with different size profile pictures. We just tried different, different call to actions with the text. This is ultimately the one that won because it was the most direct. It was directly talking at the user send me and on in this messages. The link was very easily framed there. Your eye goes exactly where it needs to go. So this is the initial touch point for every user and NGL. Every user that comes into NGL discovers it by encountering it in the wild on their friends Instagram story. So your initial touch point essentially is your friend endorsing this product, which is very powerful. Right. So once you tap on the link, you go to a website inside of Instagram where you can send a message. You can tap on the dice to get example messages and these also, you know, change every second or so. So you can send a message when you send it. We tell you to get your own messages or send another message. When you get your own messages, you are sent to the app store where you download the app. Then pretend it's your profile picture, not mine. Then you come to the app, you follow the instructions and it keeps your mind. You came from your friend doing this. So when I talked about earlier the notion of getting people through, you know, getting earlier, you came from your friend, your friend posted this. You sent a message. You did that core action that you now know your friends are going to do. So this is one of the key learnings that I found because the motivation was so strong, we were able to get users through a four step tutorial. So you follow the instructions, copy your link, share your link in your story, and then these four steps right here where you click on sticker button, click on link. We tell you to paste your link, we tell you to frame your link, and then you go and do it pretend obviously this is your PFP not mine. Then you get messages. Remember you sent a message to your friend at the beginning of this loop. Now you get messages. So notifications are super important, super, super important. Then here's your messages in your app. You open the messages. You can reply by putting it on your story and then you can type your response. So really what this is in summed up is clear expectation, minimal actions and a variable reward formula. That's what's happening here. You're starting with seeing what's going to happen to you. You're starting with seeing your friend posted a link and your friend got replies. Because you'll see your friend posted a link and maybe they put in they got a couple replies as well. In many cases actually we found that users wouldn't actually send messages until or the bulk of users wouldn't send messages until their friend had already shared a reply. Because sometimes your friend posted a link and like, oh, but nobody replied to it. So there was a user comfort there too by getting a user to share just the link and share the replies. Then more people sent replies because those people felt comfortable to do it. So it's an interesting kind of comfort level on both sides. And this is something that I think about in viral design. So this is the NGL case study, which was I said, and explicit explicit loop, right, tap on my NGL link sending messages and then maybe you'll, you'll get your own messages. Then there are implicit loops, right? So for example, TikTok, TikTok, whenever you export a video and send it to your friend, there's always a watermark and the watermark bounces around the screen so you can't really crop it out. And there are sites where you literally crop out the TikTok watermark where they take the watermark off because people don't like it. But it was a very effective growth loop because what TikTok did is just have videos from TikTok, posted on Instagram, posted on to various platforms, posted on YouTube, and then people would see, oh, this is funny video, this is an entertaining video, TikTok, I'm going to go down to TikTok. And then once they had TikTok and they see more funny TikToks, they think about, oh, I should probably open up TikTok, right? So this is an implicit one, implicit growth loop here because you're seeing the TikTok logo, you're registering the content came from there, but it's not asking you to tap a link, it's not asking you to do some kind of core action. It's simply reminding you that this piece of content came from this app so you should maybe open that app at some point, maybe now or maybe later. And this is really a big strategy of how TikTok was able to take over the last five, six years. So to review, we have four major terms that we define, emotional hooks and core human drivers, right? This is what gets people into a viral app. And it's important to think about this with the viral design aspect is how do we carry in the emotional hook from that ad, from that UGC content, or from your friend posting something on their social media or your friend sending you something. How do we carry that emotional hook into the design? How do we target the right core, even driver? K factor, right? K factor, like we talked about, is super important for maintaining and tracking how viral your app actually is. So I'm also really making sure that you orient your decisions around K factor. It's very important. I guess I'd always track everything and figure out where your users are coming from. We also talked about social proof, right? And how social proof is really important establishing comfort. And comfort is essential to create viral growth loop, right? For our growth loops, something that have been used to grow massive apps across multiple sectors, right? We talked about TikTok with an implicit growth loop with the watermark, Vine did that. X is now doing that. That's a very common practice than NGL with link sharing. Many other apps use link sharing as well. Yeah, really that's the main bulk of this first modules. These are the important terms that I'm always thinking about when I'm designing. Before we jump into Figma, before we talk about branding and we talk about colors and fonts and that fun stuff, it flows and user journeys and on-boarding and what to ask for. I really think it's important to just remember what makes an app go viral and why we are going to design things the way we're going to design them and how we're going to think about these things. So, yeah, one thing I'm going to talk about now, I'm going to kind of just kick off the next section right now. Okay, so this is going to be like a rough draft of me talking about curating the first session. So, section two of my viral app design module is called curating the first session. A lot of people think about apps in terms of D1, D7, D3, etc. I think of apps more in terms of section one, session two, etc. I think this makes decision making much easier because we're focused on sessions, we're not focused on more of the long tail, attentive type features. I like to focus first on like what are they doing in session one? Section one is the most important, right? So, we're going to talk about onboarding, that's going to be part of this section. We're going to talk about core actions, right? What are the things that you're doing on the app? We're going to talk about onboarding, the initial experience, what questions are we asking the users? What do they have to provide and sign up as far as information, building profiles, long onboarding versus short onboarding? We're going to talk about what the benefits are for long versus short versus long. And we're going to talk about everything in onboarding. I'm going to show examples of onboarding of my own apps, as well as apps of other members of the mafia. We're also talking about core actions. Core actions is the action that people are taking on your app the majority of the time. This is the most important, essential action that users are taking. In the example of Snapchat, it's sending stats, right? Pretty simple. For TikTok, it's scrolling the for you. For NGL, it's posting a link and getting replies from your followers. Figuring out your core action is essential for also figuring out short versus medium versus long onboarding. And your core action dictates what information you're going to ask people to do. Because you may not need all the permissions, right? We're going to talk about permission, we're going to talk about notification permissions, camera permissions, contact permissions, how to prompt them correctly. Because you have to figure out what the core action is going to be to know what the onboarding is going to require. And then it all becomes this self-sustaining cycle. So don't think if these are things in direct order. We're going to be figuring this out at the same time. So we're going to talk about single player versus multiplayer experiences. Designing a single player app versus designing a multiplayer app and what that means. We're going to talk about magic moments, right? How do we deliver a dopamine hit in the app? How do we get people excited? What's that moment where they feel the apps value and they lock in that comprehension of the app and its purpose for Tinder. It's getting a match, right? For NGL, it's getting a message on your link. For, you know, Duolingo, it's hitting a streak for Snapchat. It's also maintaining a streak, right? I like to use notifications, confetti, halftax, excitement, right? Making magic moments truly magic. And we're going to show a few examples of magic moments. In right, share, and paywalls. We're going to talk about walls and walls versus hurdles. You're going to talk about what a hard date is. Hard date for sharing, hard date for inviting, hard, you know, a hard paywall. We're going to talk about various examples of these and we're going to show them. North Star Metrics. The North Star Metric is the key metric reflecting user value and viral success, which guides design choices. Users funding wallets on bags is a North Star Metric. NGL posting is a North Star Metric. North Star Metrics affects every other metric. It's the main driver of success for the app. It should be very obvious to identify with the North Star. For Zoom University, my viral double dating app, the North Star Metric was number of minutes per average call time. We fell in the call time as higher. People had better conversations with one another, which led to more magic moments of people connecting and getting dropped into group chats. We wanted to maximize quality of call. This is this section. I'm really excited to dive into this section because there's a lot of great things to talk about. Let's start with onboarding. Alright, welcome back. We're going to do the next round. This is titled Curating the First Session. One of the questions I get asked extremely often is always about people ask about retention. People ask about D1, D7 retention, D30. We have these conversations about retention. I like to have those conversations, but really the conversation I enjoy more than I think is more impactful to the successful viral app is talking about sessions. Not talking in terms of days, talking in terms of sessions. Users can turn out very, very quickly if you don't have a great session one, session two, etc, etc. Experience. We're going to talk about curating the first session. We're going to talk about what it is that we're going to be doing to curate the first session. We're going to hop in now with onboarding. The way I define it is the initial experience that conveys value in hooks users. Short onboarding and long onboarding. This is the biggest question I get as well. People ask me, 100, should I have short onboarding or long onboarding? What is the correct answer? There is no correct answer. It just depends what you're maximizing for. Short maximizes for speed and virality. You want to get them into the product quickly. You want to get them to hit the end of onboarding. Get in there fast and do whatever core actions the app requires them to do. Long onboarding, it does risk that friction. It creates investment. It creates some cost. If you spend a lot of time onboarding, filling out personal information for a profile like a dating app. Or going through a long offer wall, ending in some kind of hard paywall. Where you're answering questions and quizzing and what have you. That creates investment. Both are correct. It just depends what you want to optimize for. I said the word core action. The core action is the primary user behavior on the app. It's really easy to spot this. If you don't know the core action of your app, you're probably overthinking the question. I have some examples here of apps. The core action of the core action is scrolling and watching content. Getting you on the four new pages. One percent of the people are creating content. The 99 percent are consuming content. The core action of the app is scrolling. TikTok would want to maximize for how fast and at what rate do we drop them into the core action? With TikTok, you open the app and you can immediately start swiping. Then you have to sign up when you interact with various tab icons. They want you to get right into the action. They want you to be immediately immersed. That's one core action. I'd say similar type of photos. I'm originally taking photos, applying filters, messaging. Obviously, it's expanded a lot. The core of this is feed. Most people are absorbing content in the feed. Whether it's the real feed or the main feed. Or watching their friend's stories. That's where the main core action is on an app like Instagram. You want to maximize getting you into the app to get to that core action. Snapchat. Core action is taking pictures or it's snapping and chatting. The core action of an app like bags, this is my fintech app, is trading and creating meme coins. That's the core action of the app. That's what we get everybody to do. At the end of onboarding, we prompt you to fund your wallet. We have you do that with Apple Pay or we have just crypto. Our goal is to get you into the app so you can start trading. With NGL, one of my other apps. The core action is posting a link, posting replies. Just having fun on your story. That's the core action. We want to get you into the app and want to get you to that core action as quickly as possible. At the right rate. And have the user be in the right mindset. The user needs to be primed and programmed and ready for that core action. There's a chat GBT, another great example. The core action of chat GBT is prompting chat GBT. So typing. Hinge primary action would be sending likes to various profiles. That's what they want you to do. They want you to spend time in the feed. WhatsApp, obviously, is texting and messaging. And the origin is free texting, free messaging. That's the core action. And Kalei, core action Kalei is obviously scanning food, scanning your items, figuring out what's in it, based on calories and various nutrients. And then logging your food, having a streak, and being healthy. That's the core action of Kalei. So these are the core actions that I always like to think about the core actions of an app when I go into designing them because we have to think about what is the core action and when do we want the user to do it? And what do we want them to see before they do it? How are they primed? So we're going to continue talking about this. But some notes here. So figure out what the core action will be at the end of onboarding, and depending on the action you can optimize for shorter long onboarding. So core actions and onboarding length have a direct relationship. I always keep them in mind, right? Because this is going to inform also the next thing I'm going to talk about which is the things that we're going to get into sign up during onboarding and how that correlates to the core action of the app as well. So with NGL it's a short sign up for the sharing prompt, right? Maximizes for virality and sharing. It's multiplayer, variable reward, and it's primarily an external motivator, right? You want to post an NGLing because you want to get other people to send you messages. Maybe you saw your friend do it. You want the external motivation, external validation. You want to feel cool. You want to feel socially accepted. So we have a short sign up, right? We want to get you in there fast to get you into this quality, at least we want to get you in there fast and get you into this multiplayer experience. So CaliI as another example, right? Long sign up flow with a hard paywall. This drives investment, right? Because you go down this long journey and we're going to show it in a second and it creates some cost. And it's a single player experience, more of an internal motivator, right? So different ways of looking at the apps, and that way you can see, well a short onboarding works for this, but a long onboarding actually works for this, right? That's the purpose of bringing these up. Yeah, so multiplayer, variable rewards, NGL messages, Instagram likes, or single player consistency, dual-lingo streaks, CaliI streaks. You get the purpose. This is kind of the differentiator here, but both are correct, ultimately. Long or short onboarding is correct. So next we're going to talk about this. So, depending on the type of app, that you're building, you're going to want to ask for different information in sign up. This I think really comes down to what is required, what do you need, and what's a nice to have, right? So a great example of this. In the context of a dating app, having your age, very important, right? In the context of an app to share recipes, maybe your age is in this important, right? So figuring out what is essential, what is the final, what information do I need as the creator of this app, as the designer of this app, in order to make sure that I have all the information I need to deliver the user to that core action, right? To bring them in, and we have everything we need so they can do their thing, right? So in the case of dating, how do we get all their information and sign up, so we can build their profile, and then we can take their profile, and we can push it out to our users and they can start swiping, right? So think about what you need to get from the user. So what kind of authentication, right? What kind of auth? You could auth with phone, and then a 2FA text code. You could auth with email. You could do Apple, Google, X, various single sign on options. There's many, many options. The way that I see it is that in absent-lead, I like to lean away personally from complicating the auth unless the user wants to, right? So a great example of this is in my FinTech app bags, our auth, we offer basically every option, right? Apple, Google, X, e-mail phone, everything. But we have 2FA as well. So if you want to go deeper, you can add even authentication app, right? If you want to go deeper, it works for that kind of app because it's a FinTech app, right? An app like NGL had no auth when we first released it. There was no auth at all. It was simply asked on the screen a second, but it had an absolute no auth. Agent Birthday, you know, that's important for certain apps. Definitely in social apps, definitely in various marketplaces, things involving money, you know, all of that, of course, gender. That's also very important, right? Dating, of course, super important. Health and fitness, that's also important. Profile picture, you know, the thing with profile pictures. Profile picture. So the thing with profile pictures is, I think that it depends on the app. I'll say that a lot of the times, unless it makes sense in the right context, users don't really care to upload a profile picture, and they'll either skip it or they'll upload a photo that's not in them. So I would just really think about the context in which they're uploading the profile picture. You know, I like to grab the profile picture from the social account, right? If they log in with X, log in with Instagram, log in with other various methods. I like to just grab their profile picture of their PFP at that point and not have them have to upload it. That's just my preference. You could also use iCloud. You could also use iCloud to pull PFP. But I think it works in certain contexts. You know, use that with discretion. Buy on interest, very much social dating, marketplaces, those types of apps, interactive quizzes. This is something I've seen a lot in apps. You know, apps like Headspace, I've seen them, it's an ask like quitter that we're going to talk about soon. Kaliai had these interactive quizzes. This is a great feature of onboarding as a way to prime the user for paywall. Permissions are super important as well in onboarding. You know, we're just doing the grab and the grab notifications, photos, contacts, camera, mic, etc. We need to think about what we're going to grab because as you're watching us, you should be thinking about how many things do you need to grab and how many screens is that going to be? You know, because you're going to have to have a photo upload screen, a screen to, you know, confirm the photo. You need the contact prompt. You're going to need the contact states when they've been invited. You're going to need to have the open-graph images. You know, invite your friend over iMessage. It has a nice, you know, link image and a nice, you know, piece of text with some good copy. Right? These are all the things you have to think about. So I like to start this right when we do onboarding. We think about what do we need from the user? So this is NGL. When the AppWint viral in June of 2022, this was our onboarding. So as you can see, it is a very, very fast onboarding. In the previous section, we talked about how users that came into NGL came in from their friend's Instagram story. So it came from their friend's Instagram story. They went on the website, sent a message, downloaded the app. Now they're here. So we have an influx of millions of people trying to get into this app and participate in the thing that their friends are doing. And they've gotten the stamp of approval by all their friends that it's socially acceptable to do. So our goal was to get them as quickly as possible into the app and to the core action. With NGL, it was simply a one question onboarding. What is your Instagram handle? That's it. That's all we asked for. No off, nothing. Since then, we've added a few steps. But this was the core flow that made it viral. When you think about the core action on NGL, the only thing that's really required is to just know the person's Instagram and to know in order to access their PSP. So because the NGL core action was sharing something and we wanted to get the user in quickly, and we also knew we needed very little information from the user. This is why we made the decision to have onboarding be this sparse. I said earlier, I'm going to show these at our very unorthodox, but this is what maximized virality. Because remember, we have this screen, but then we have the copying the link, and we have the four step tutorial where the user has to manually add the link. And this was before you could automatically copy links on the stories. This was before anyone knew how to use the Instagram link feature, right? In August of 2021, I co-founded NGL with a couple of friends. This was right when Instagram had released the link feature for all users. You used to have to have 10,000 followers in order to post the link. So the second that happened, we immediately started working on NGL. At the time, it was called something different. I later rebranded it to NGL. But ultimately, this onboarding worked because of the core action that we required the user to do. And we knew that it was a complicated multi-step core action. So we wanted to minimize the time in onboarding. The user was already sold. We didn't have to sell them, right? And that's a stark contrast from the next app we're going to talk about. So now we're going to talk about another app, which is CalliNi, an app with over 10 million downloads and multi-seven-figure monthly revenue. I built by a very talented team, am I also add? And let's dive into this one. It's a very different onboarding flow than what we just did with NGL. So I want to zoom out here and just kind of get like one of a bird's eye view. As we can see, this is a much longer flow, much longer flow than NGL. When it comes to onboarding. So this is a moving gift. I'm going to start the beginning, which I think is awesome, because it demonstrates what the app does. It's showing you what it does. So it shows the skin, the food, and the little pop-up coming up. And I think it's a phenomenal way of explaining what the app does in a visual way. So definitely very impressive with the onboarding video. So then you can get started. We have a few authentication options, Apple, Google, email. Pretty standard. I think with Calais demo, it makes a lot of sense to do Apple, Google, and email versus leading with phone number. It does make sense to me. I think that this really just comes down to one information that you want. So if the phone number is important to you for some reason, it's not going to be app-sure around the phone number. In more social apps, I'd say it makes sense to have phone number. But they've opted for these three authentication options. Then we have, you know, this is the way if you were to choose email with code. Then there's, you know, a gender option. Really simple. Like the little quiz. How many workouts do you do per week? So people can really, you know, feel like they're investing into this app as they're going down this, going down this little quiz. We'll progress far at the top, big back button. Great UI here. And if you really notice what I love about this onboarding is you know exactly where to look. The text is really big at the top. We have a clear progression. You don't feel like you're going to be here forever and you do see progress. And you just know exactly where to look. The buttons are big. There's haptics. It's very clear. It's really a very simple onboarding. I think that's really the key. And we're going to see that with all the onboarding. I'm going to show you. They are quite simple. As long as they are, the UI is very clean and the UX is very simple. And it's a recognizable pattern. Right? So these are, you know, very simple patterns to recognize. So we're showing where does you hear about us? Then we move to asking a question about trying competitors. I'm sure many people have. Right? So this is a very relevant question for for Kali. I because at the end of the onboarding you guys are in C that we have a hard paywall. Right? So this is really about understanding who are these people that are coming into the product? How they try to their apps? Where do they hear about us? And selling them on why the product is superior. So we have, you know, a really nice animation here with great stats. Very clean UI. You know, you just know exactly where it's a look. We have heightened weights. You know, so people can input that. Obviously it's a calorie tracking app. Heighten weight is important. When were you born? This is also important, right? Example of asking for birthday. We talked about above, you know, why do you ask for certain things and not others? Right? So for an app like NGL, you know, we're not going to ask for heightened weight. Right? For an app like Kali, I, yes, knowing when someone's born is important. What is your goal? Right? So this is very interesting here. And this is used, I'm assuming, to create some kind of split path where you show, yeah, losing weight. And I'm sure there's instances for gaining weight. And this whole section. So then we have this question, what is your goal? Right? Another important question. Losing weight, maintaining, or gaining weight. So what I like about this onboarding is we have a good mix of user is giving information. Right? Gender workouts. Asking these questions to the user, the user is answering. The user is on a journey of giving information and sharing, yes and no, kind of answering, you know, A or B type questions, while getting sold and continuing the input information, continuing the input information, then being asked another quiz question, do you see how it's moving? Do you see how you're not stuck in the same format? This is a very, very smart onboarding. So I feel like when it comes to long onboarding that requires lots of information up front, like Kali does. Right? Because this is important. You need to have your height and weight, you need to have where you're born. We need to know the goals. These are all important things. We move from goals to what is your desired weight. Then we have a screen here that is, you know, programmatic, depending on losing or gaining from the step here. I like this one a lot, the slider of how fast you want to reach your goal. I really like that. Because that's a question everybody has, right? Think of you are a user and you want to lose five pounds. You want to gain five pounds. Question you're going to have for this, you know, Kali AI app is AI app that's going to help me lose weight and help me track my calories. It's like how quickly can I do it? That's a valid question. So what I like about this onboarding is that we're really jumping around into different types of, you know, really nice interactions, sliders, buttons, scrolls. It's very dynamic, but at the same time it's very simple onboarding experience. So I would definitely look at this one when you're doing your apps and noticing how there's really only one accent color. It's very mild chromatic, very simple. And we move from, you know, answering a question to being sold again, right? It lose twice as much weight with Kali AI versus on your own. Right? So we got sold a little bit back here. We answered more questions. We had some fun with some cool interactions and some haptics. And then now we're here. Lose twice as much weight with Kali AI versus on your own. So notice the weaving and how we're filling out information, we're answering questions and we're being sold at the same time. You're asking about another question. Following diet, what do you want to accomplish? Right? And then another screen of really just positive enforcement, which some of me is really important. People need positive enforcement. I love this, you know, this hand, this high five. And I love this high five. Now we have another screen that really is a positive reinforcement type screen. So you go from answering questions to positive reinforcement. You know, selling the user that the user can have that weight transition that they want to have. Then we have another screen here for privacy and security, which is just great for trust factor. And really a lot of this is also, you know, it's about gaining trust. It's about filling this information out, educating the user on what the app is doing, and how the app can help. And, you know, really focusing on building trust. We have integrations connecting into your apps, you know, skippable. You know, being able to, you know, add these extra things, answering yes and no's, right? So it's a very interactive, very, very interactive flow. You know, we asked, we have a, we move. It's a very interactive flow, which I think is what makes it really good. Because you're moving pretty quick through it. The questions are very simple. And the UI, you know, actions and animations are very delightful. So it helps push you through this experience. As many screens as it is, it actually feels very fast. And there's not really a moment where you don't know where to look or what to do, which I really like. Then we have four screens here. Asking questions, yes and no. Right, we've switched from the buttons and the swipes and the taps into the yes and no buttons. We have a, give us a rating screen. Getting a rating screen in onboarding. It's not something I've personally done. But I do think that it's very valid if you have a medium to long onboarding to end that in. Yes. I'll be honest, I haven't really done that with my apps. I've really asked for ratings after some kind of magic moment, which we're going to talk about. So this is not something that I've done in my own apps, but I think in an app like Callie I and other apps, it makes a lot of sense. Right. Because the more five star ratings we have. I think for an app like Callie I having a rating prompt makes a lot of sense in onboarding. Really the way I see ratings is at the end of the day on your app store page, it will build trust. So as we've already done onboarding, it makes a lot of sense if you have a medium to long onboarding. That's just my opinion. It's not something that I've tried with my apps too often, but I think it's very valid for a long onboarding, medium onboarding app. Especially like the one you're seeing right here. This is a great, give us a rating screen. We have a ref code screen. And now we have kind of this satisfying, okay, we're done. Let's generate a plan. And now we have the AI, you know, have this really delightful moment of the AI, you know, generating the plan and having the progress bar fill up. Now we have this really nice, delightful screen of, you know, counting up to 100. And we're setting it everything up for you, right? So this is a great screen. This is a great screen if you need some time to do things. I love creating delays. And you know, there's something I've done in other apps as well, but having something where you weigh a few seconds for the user to get excited and to build anticipation. So I love screens like this and it's animated. Then we have that your plan is ready, right? So we have this like delivery of something great. Like this is what the AI thinks you should be doing every day, right? Super simple screen and a very delightful experience from here to here. So now the user is here. The next screen would be a paywall. And I have a couple of them paywalls here. This is the current paywall. So it's very simple and clean. We're going to talk about paywalls in the next section, but I'm just going to pop this up here. This is a trial paywall solitizer. We'll talk about that soon. But this is the Cal AI onboarding and this is the NGL onboarding. Both of them are correct. Like I said, both are correct. It just depends on what the purpose of the app is. What is the core action? What do we need from the user for the core action? Cal AI, you need a lot of information in order to when you scan the food and you provide these insights, then you can share insights of, oh, maybe you should eat more of this or eat less of this. We have to know your height and your weight and we have to know your gender. We have to know all these things about you versus NGL, which requires very little information from the user in order for the core action to be effective. Right? Just sharing a link on your story. So I hope that answers the question of what is the right answer? I get this DM all the time. What is the right answer? Short or long onboarding? And the answer is both.

Hey everyone, welcome to the Art Mafia development module. My name is Alex Slater. I'm the founder and lead developer of Quitter. Quitter does half a million dollars in revenue a month and has done about two and a half million dollars in its total lifespan. I have a lot of a lot of information to share about building products specifically because they wasted years and I mean like two years building the perfect app that never launched and never got traction and never went anywhere. Whereas with Quitter on the other hand, I spent a week, two weeks building it, got instant validation and that just kind of parlayed into momentum that got us to this point today. So the goal of this module is to share how to build a successful app. We'll be running through how to rebuild UMACS from scratch, which was one of Blake Anderson's most successful first apps. So we'll go for the entire tutorial and how to skip a lot of the wasted time that I spent. So you don't have to spend that wasted time yourself. And by the end of this module, ideally you will have an app that is ready to be sold and you can go into the distribution module that comes right after this and start making money. So yeah, let's get started.

Okay, so one of the most important questions that you might be having is should I learn to code or should I just hire a developer to build the app for me? Now this has been asked over it over because people have to say distribution is everything and what I do like kind of strongly approve of that. I still fundamentally believe that being technical yourself is one of the highest leverage things you can do to be successful in this space. And you know, Zach, Blake and I are all proof that we kind of stick to that. Like we all built our products ourselves. And I think for the same kind of reason, like you can't outsource greatness. Products have to be good to be successful, especially long term. Okay, short short term, you can make some money. But long term is important to get the product right. And to kind of be a little bit of a perfectionist, I will say. Developers also extremely expensive. Like even the cheapest bond with the barrel like Brazilian dabs are around like six K a month. And they take super long to build products. And they don't even know what they're doing half the time. Like you usually pay for quality. And unless you've got like 10, 15 K a month to hire a solid CTO and a product guy, I'd usually just recommend learning yourself. And like I can give my viewpoint on how, so I can give my perspective on how I learn. I watched this tutorial around two, three years ago on rebuilding Twitter from scratch. It's linked right here. It's about seven hours long. And it seems like a long time. But if I learned all of my coding skills and I built quitter from scratch from this tutorial and I've quittered it's doing half a million a month. And trading seven hours of focus and of your time in your life. For the opportunity to build a super successful app, I think that's an amazing exchange of time to wealth ever. Also, like if you do decide to hire out understanding fundamentals saves money and time. But I generally wouldn't recommend this for most people. Even if your first cop laps suck, it's important to be able to code yourself. I would also say like I feel like a lot of people watching this tutorial probably don't have cash, which is one of the reasons I built and learned to code myself. So yeah, that's my take.

### Transcript

Okay, so there are two ways to hire a developer. The first option is to work with someone for equity and under the agreement that, okay, we both put in equal effort and we get equal outcomes and you run product, I run marketing, et cetera, et cetera. This is a pretty easy to do with SlaserCord, which is my personal Discord server, and I will recommend this just because I follow everyone that watches my YouTube channel to my Discord. So there's a lot of app guys in there and I'll show you it right now. Like, this is the finder co-founder chat that I recommend typing in. So as you can see, I'm looking for a marketing co-founder, 70 foot, split, whatever. Like, you kind of see it as a lot of engagement, a lot of traffic. So it's worth a, we have a chance, and you can say something like this, looking for a dad to go 50, 50 on an app with, I'll be a marketing killer. I build the app market course and I'm extremely focused on being successful with this. I have a ton of ideas and I'm ready to go all in, DM me on this jump on a call. So for example, you can copy this message, go into my Discord, post it, and you will at least get a few replies. But you might have to hustle and post a few different times and try and find someone. But we have 1,100 people in here. Everyone is super motivated and apt and I'm sure you can find one single individual that's also technical and that would love to what could be. And I would mention you bought the course because that is a really positive sign that you're putting your money up front because you want to invest in yourself like it's a massive green flag. And then here linked right here is a vested equity to protect yourself. Something that I've learned and I've learned too late and as so of a bunch of my friends, like you can blatantly learn too late, we brought people on for equity that a long term didn't provide any value and it fucked us all. So now there are like lawsuits, there's complications and it's not worth that headache. So setting up a vested equity agreement is very important. I don't know too much about it, but I just know it's really important so I would recommend going to this link and figuring out a good structure for both of you. A little personal note as well is when I started Quitter for the first time with Connor, I built all the app and we tried to work out an equity agreement or he tried to work out an equity agreement, but I was like fuck that. I don't want to agree to any sort of equity until we kind of both prove ourselves to each other. Like for example, I built the app, he was running marketing, but he couldn't run marketing until I built the app. So I put an all the upfront effort so like him taking 50% of my effort before he had done anything himself didn't make sense to me. So I said, look, let's get to like 100K revenue which sounds ridiculous before we discuss equity. And that was like a trust between both of us and you know we got to 100K revenue and then we sorted it out of the air-wizy part. And yeah, now the reason we did that is because it's important to not get trapped like a lot of co-founders change off the money, like things get really complicated. So it's important to have that level of trust and prove yourself to each other. So here are some things to look for in a founding equity-based engineer. They should be clearly competent, they should be extremely smart. They match their intensity and objectives. Like they're not just sitting around waiting or they're like unbulbored or they're not really motivated. You don't want someone like that. You don't want to hand hold someone. You want someone that's like, okay, I'm gonna fucking co this in a week and then you're gonna like you as the mocked are gonna be like, okay, I'm gonna do this strategy for Reddit. I'm gonna do this, this, this. And like you're both matching each other's intensity. That reduces the friction and the struggle. Whereas like if someone else, like if they are for example pulling the way and you're not, you know, like it's not gonna be successful long term. They should also be willing to sacrifice time and money for an unproven product. They should kind of know what they're getting into. You know, you should explain or emphasize that. It's gonna be long and hard for a long time while that depends on how successful your marketing is. But usually in most cases, it's long and hard and there's no results. And then you get like one result and then it gets to 10 and then born like you've got a booming business. But like there is a big gap of time between that could be months, like several, several months. So just make sure you both understand that. So there is like, to emphasize again, there is opportunity cost as a good developer to waste your time on a project that it's uncertain and he's not getting money from. So, and then on that note, it's better to find an engineer that's younger rather than older because if they're older, they have financial responsibilities like paying for rent or maybe providing for the kids or whatever. So they will be less inclined to work on an unproven product rather than someone that's young and hungry that's in school that doesn't need to be earning money, right? Woo, wow. They should also have high agency and like if they fuck up, they admit they fucked up and like they make the right steps to correct that fuck up and don't just blame other people, blame me or whatever. You should also vibe with them. You should just be generally friends. Another bonus benefit is like, if you've had the same goals as someone you work with, like me and Clonamie Co. Fanar and Quitter, we have the same goals, we want the same things. This is really easy to vibe with and like understand each other. Whereas like, for example, like maybe someone's super materialistic but someone isn't and then like, yeah, then the objectives or goals or whatever are misaligned and you know, that causes friction. So it's not that complex to be honest. And I want to emphasize, like you don't want to just, if you don't just want to find someone super technical, you want to find someone that's technical and you're vibe with. And I'd like kind of prioritize the person you vibe with over just being super technical because you know, the struggles of building and growing a business are very tough and it's super important to share that pain and that growth together rather than suffering silently and you just have a fucking coding robot doing what he's told. You know what I mean? Like you want to have conversations and stuff like that. But yeah, that's pretty much how to do it from an equity standpoint. I hope I covered all bases there. There's an over option which is crack devs, which is one of our partners. You can hire their team and they will build you an MVP for around 5K and then there are some like maintenance on top of that if you choose, but they are very solid and I highly recommend them. Just say you came from Atmaphia and they will give you a bit of a discount. But yeah, that's also an over option. But again, as I said, you know, it's less fun, less exciting. And I think the journey should prioritize being fun because if you have fun while doing it, it doesn't feel like work. So that's my point on hiring developer. That helps.

Okay, great. Now we've caught up. It's time to get into nitty gritty of the technical things we'll be using to build this application. I will start by saying the language we're using is SwiftUI and which is a language developed by Apple and I generally recommend it for building apps. There are other platforms like React Native or Expo or Flutter but they aren't as smooth as SwiftUI and so I would totally recommend that. That's all I coded with. Now the problem with it is that it's limited to iOS and iPhones for now. I know they are working on like an Android version but for now it's only iPhones which means you won't be able to sell your app on Android but in my opinion it doesn't really matter in the early days because most of the revenue is generated from Apple devices in the US specifically. Well because the US is so rich and the US the US's market penetration with iPhones is like 99% so you shouldn't really worry about Android too much. Also all of these like massive apps like Instagram for example they're built on SwiftUI for iOS and then they're built on something else for Android. I think it's Kotlin so it's just like very like it's optimizing for the platform that it's sold on so I wouldn't think about multi-platform right now. Yeah and like even my friend Blake Anderson he built I think it was 10x or it was Apex or something on React Native during PMF or Die and they rebuilt it from scratch because it wasn't that smooth and iOS and you like optimized for things being smooth and the reason you optimize for things being smooth and intuitive and natural etc is because it's easier to sell whereas if something's jittery or you can feel it like not really being designed for you people are more likely to turn or not actually pay it for subscription. So these are some things to keep in mind when it comes to choosing the language but this tutorial will be in SwiftUI because that's what I'm most comfortable with and that's all I know to code in.

Alright boys and girls welcome back. We are now at the part of this tutorial where we're walking through different software and platform link creating accounts and actually doing things instead of just listening to me. So get yourself ready, get the document up, we're going to be doing a lot of setup and let's get right into it. So the most essential part and most essential step in the beginning is creating an Apple developer account. So you just click this link, start an enrollment and you can choose to either create a brand new iCloud account or just use your personal one. It's truly up to you. Once you've logged in this would usually prompt you to log in but I'm already signed in so it doesn't matter. Once you've signed in it will then ask you to pay subscription. I would choose the personal 99 dollar a year plan. Just it will say your full name on the app store but it doesn't really matter for now. Just as long as you have the membership we can start moving forward with building the app and then you could change everything else later. So once that's purchased we're all set to go and that's a solid start to make an editorial work. So yeah good job guys.

### Transcript

Alright, so now that you've enrolled into Apple Developer, let's get the IDE and let's start coding. Very simple again, just click the blue Xcode button and then there's a blue download button on the top right. You click that, make sure you download the original Xcode and not the beta. The beta is unstable and also doesn't let you push new apps to the App Store. So just make sure you get the original Xcode, click on it. It will then pop up the Mac App Store. Really simple again, download install. Once that's done, you make sure you follow it. This is where it gets a little bit intricate. Once that's installed, open it. You'll get prompted with this screen. Go in the top left of your Mac, you see what it says Xcode up here. You click settings and in accounts, click the bottom left plus icon as you can see. And log into the account that you just enrolled Apple Developer subscription onto. Very crucial step. Once you've done that, let's get ready to start the project. So this is where the fun starts happening. So get excited boys. You click create new project, app, make sure it's an app. You can close whatever you want for simplicity sake. Then it'll call us UMX clone. An organization identifier is very important. And the team. So I have two teams because I'm also on the Cudder account, but I'll just add it to the Cudder account. For the organization identifier, you can do whatever you want. I have Comm.Slayder because that's my last name. You can do Comm.Anderson for Blake for example, or your company name. Let's just say super health. So now it's Comm.Superhealth.umxClone. This is one of one people can't copy it, but this just helps Apple identify your app on the App Store. So this is bug like permanent. You can't change it if you've already put like, yeah, just it's permanent. Just make sure it's right. But it doesn't really matter. It's very back end. It's not front end facing. So click next. Choose a place for your folder with your code to be. For example, mine's in the GitHub folder, which I'm happy with. Click create. Well, I've already got one called UMXClone. My bad. UMXClone 2. Next, create and bomb. Now app has built. You can see a preview on the right side. It's about to load. Just give it a second. And there you go. So now you can see a preview of the app. And now you can, yeah, like now things are starting to get exciting. But yeah, that's the escrow setup. One more thing I'd recommend. Go into here. So click on this tab on the blue top left. And then go to general in targets. Make sure this is all selected as a mine. And remove iPad, remove Mac, and remove Apple Vision. This just complicates things. And if you push your app to the app store with those checks, you can't then remove them. So you need to permanently keep supporting iPad, making sure everything's like fitting on the screen for iPad. And annoys us that could a lot because we can't do anything about it. So I've removed that straight away. But yeah, that should be the very simple escrow setup. In the next section, we'll go through kind of building things. And yeah, good shit, guys.

Alright, so now we're in a really good spot. We've enrolled an Apple developer. We've set up Xcode. Actually, there is one more thing in Xcode I just forgot. Make sure you drop this to like 17.0 because it was previously on 18.5, which means anyone that's not on iOS 18.5 cannot use your app. So this is very crucial. Drop it down to 17. And 17 should be just fine. But remember to do this. Very important, don't miss out. Okay, so this is the core tech stack. And I originally thought I would like run through like going, like setting up the accounts, like kind of going through the platforms. But to be honest, I will do that later down the line. I just want to show you guys what the tech stack would be. For me, I use Firebase. You can also use SuperBase, but I'm not really qualified in that realm. So I'm going to stick to Firebase, which is what I know. We use SuperBall for the pay-offs. We use MixPanel for Analytics. And we also use Adjust for a bit of Analytics as well. But more on the track, the side of things, whereas MixPanel was like very usage-based. So we can see what users are doing on the app, when they drop off, et cetera, et cetera. We are also going to use the chat GPT API to rate the faces of people that are scanning their face on the UMX clone. So that's important to note. And I'll run through installing all of this, like when it comes to it, I think that's way more helpful. The only thing that you immediately need to download is S-sepsimples. So go to this page, it's linked. This is ByApple. There's a download button on the top right. Again, I'd recommend downloading six instead of the beta, because the beta is unstable. And I just personally wouldn't recommend it right now. So then, download six, and I'll show you what S-sepsimples looks like. It just gives you access to a bunch of icons that you can use for your app, which we will also be using to create setup later down the line during this tutorial. So that's all from this side. And we're ready to move on to our architecture.

Now if you're pretty serious about coding long term, this is very important to know, whereas if you're just following this tutorial as fine, I will match this architecture anyway, but the most optimal way to structure code in SwiftUI is model, view, model, and view. So the view model acts as the back end, and that back end works with the front end, and also the models to make a very cohesive app. Now, as might be confusing, there's a little diagram on the screen that explains how it works, like user lectures from the view, go back to the view model, and that transmutes back to the model and then the view. It's a pretty simple structure, but I generally recommend knowing or understanding this before we get started, instead of over-complicated code, et cetera, et cetera. But as I said, during this tutorial, I will stick to this architecture anyway, so you have nothing to worry about, but longer term is important to know this is very fundamental so in a long-lasting app, we'll say that.

Okay, now we're going to talk about AI prompting and how to expedite development by utilizing AI. In my opinion, and I've spoke to Blake Anderson about this, the reason apps have blown up recently and the reason we've all got very rich and successful off of it is because AI has lowered the barriers to entry significantly. It saves a lot of time. It's super smart and like you can build and test and validate things at lightning speed. Here is a bunch of charity prompts that you can use. We'll be using this first one to begin this tutorial and there's a bunch of other ones that are very simple. Like make a poor to refresh list and SwiftUI or create a SwiftUI button with a spring bounce animation when tapped. These are all like really simple prompts but they work. And instead of like needing to learn to learn to code like knowing what ins and outs this and that, you can just ask check GPT to build it for you. And as long as you have like a fundamental understanding of how Swift and how code works, you can build anything. So we use that a lot in Quitter. We use a lot to expedite my work with the community. Like most of the community functions, built by AI. I mean, I understand how they work now but like I didn't initially and it just did it for me and now we have a fucking working community that has a thousand posts a day. So it really does work. And usually the more detailed the better, as you can see this prompt that we're going to use for the beginning of the tutorial, I want to build a UMACS clone in SwiftUI. Okay, very explicit. Then UMACS is an app where you can take a picture of your face and it will rate your looks out of ten. This should be out of 100. Yeah, that should be right. This image should be passed to the OpenAI API via MacPause repository and the results should display on the front end. If you coded before you can understand what it means by results front end, whatever, and repository, very simple. I will explain later. The scores that should give you are overall rating, potential, masculinity, skin quality and jawline and anchiko, sorry. So this is exactly what UMACS has. So I'll just pull up there right now. Oh shit. As you can see, there is an overall, there's a potential, masculinity, skin quality, jawline and cheekbones. And it's just his face and that image is rated by ChatGbT. Very, very simple stuff. So yeah, that's the problem I'm going to give ChatGbT in the next section of this tutorial. But usually just the general rule is like the more explicit the better. It always share information about your tech stack. So let's, for example, say I'm using Firebase or I'm using OpenAI instead of Claude or Gemini. And also if it doesn't, if you copy paste the code into your IDE and what you kind of expect it or it's not kind of functioning how you want it to function, just say change this. It's doing one thing, but I want it to do another thing instead. And ChatGbT will be very fast to fix it and you can like move a lightning speed. And I'm going to show you how fast we can build a UX competitor right now. So let's get into it.

Hey everyone, welcome back to the development module. We're finally going to be building the app focusing essentially on the core feature. Now what is the core feature you may ask? Well if we look at Kelly Eye as an example their core feature is taking a picture of food and then estimating the calories. That's what they started with, that's what they launched with and it worked really well. Now of course they're developing it, they have teams, they have you can connect Apple Health account etc etc but to be honest in the early days this is all fluff and you should be focusing on what is the most important feature of my app. Let me build that once that is built you can go out and validate it. So yeah for the UMax clone we essentially are going to be taking a picture of our face and then just displaying the results on the screen. That's all we need to do for this like MVP and I'm going to run through how to build this. This will be kind of a longer form video and you know I'm not going to like retake this many times I'm just going to like throw it all at you. You guys to be following along are we kind of explaining what things are as we go and you'll see how I transform this like hello world screen into like a functioning app and including the chat GBA API as well. So let's get fucking started boys. So the way I like to start is I love like logo straight away like maybe it seems stupid but I'm just going to go UMax. I'm going to go .footway.bold.font.title. There you go and then we're going to space this to the top. There we go and you can see the example on the right side that's exactly what we're building it's all getting like rendered in real time. Okay so next we want a button so we're going to create a button actually I'm going to zoom in a little bit just so you guys can see. Okay button label. So the label is essentially like what the button looks like and I'm not going to teach you guys how to code that I run through the fundamentals. We're going to go image system name and then we use the system name from the SF symbols library. So I can go plus dot circle and then comes up with this and we're just going to use this. We're going to make it resizable, skeletal, skeletal fit, frame and we're going to make it about like 30 pixels wide or maybe even bigger maybe 90. Yeah or 80 I think. Yeah okay because it's a core feature I'll keep it pretty big although like editing of course you can change this and again I'm going to teach you guys how to code but you can change the color so if you do foreground color maybe we make it red. So that's red. I think maybe purple is great for now though. Okay let's do purple and then yes that is all good. Great. So now this button should be the core feature and we're going to write the logic for this now and essentially when you click this button it should pop up a camera view and then you can take a picture once the picture is taken I get sent to the chat GBT API and then the API will rate the looks and then display that back on the front end and what I recommend is going here on the left side sorry right clicking and clicking add package dependencies going back into the document that you guys all provided with from the course and copy in this link GitHub.com slash Mac post. Open AI then you go back into Xcode paste this in the package URL section at the top right pasting it and click add in package and then adding it to you Mac clone 2. I've already added this previously in another cup but just it's really simple click on the Mac's clone 2 or whatever you call your project and click add package and boom it's available. So I'm going to ask chat GBT right now I will record it just give me a second I'm going to pause and pause I'll formulate a prompt and it will allow us pretty much to click on this button and then display an image sorry the camera view on the front end just so we could take the photo so I'll be back in a second. Okay guys so the first next step is to go to your web browser and what you need to do is get the API key from chat GBT so go to platform.openai.com which will open this web page and then if you have an account if you never had an account before just create one and if you already have a chat GBT account just log in it's simple as that then you click start building in the top right it might ask you for your organization name I'm just going to say you max clone create organization and I'll invite my team later we don't need to answer this and then we can call this first API key you max and click generate. I'll then give you a test key so just copy this and we'll bring it over to the next part of the tutorial I'll be back in one sec. Actually I just remember it is likely recommended to buy credits because they probably have a lot of spam so I would just pay for five hours of credits not a big deal and then join me after you've topped up your account.

Hey everyone, welcome back to finally the tutorial on how to rebuild a successful app from scratch. Now a slight change of plan, we will be rebuilding Cal AI from scratch, focusing on like the fundamental feature, which pretty much is the taking a picture of your food and estimating the calories instead of your mix. The reason for this is because OpenAI and ChatGPT, they are limiting me from rating other people's faces, which is totally fair and there's not a problem. Cal AI, a little bit of background. Cal AI makes free and a half million dollars a month, they have almost 10 million downloads, and I'm going to run you through exactly how I would rebuild it from scratch and what kind of version I would launch into the market if I wanted to make a competitor, for example. Now I will preface this by saying I don't suggest you make a competitor to Cal AI, I mean even if you do, there is a lot of competition and a lot of people have tried and failed, but I want you to more use this tutorial as a kind of a visual representation on how you can build a super successful app from scratch and then you can translate these same concepts, these same execution I'm doing now into other ideas and other apps. So let's get started. The first thing you need to do is to download Xcode and once you've downloaded it, go to the top left, click Settings and log into your Apple account. You log in by clicking this plus icon on the bottom left, clicking Apple account, continue and then entering your details, super simple stuff. Once you've done that, you will click Create New Project, app next, call it Cal AI or whatever else you want to call it, and then make sure you come up with your own organization identifier. You can do like com.slater or com.maphia or com.whatever else, but it's totally unique and you need to come up with your own name. This can't be repeated by other people and you can't just copy the one I've written down. So I'm just going to do Mafia Tutorial. You can leave all of this as a standard and then choose a folder and destination where you'd want to code in. So I'm happy with the GitHub folder so I'll just click Create, bottom right and bomb. Your app is now live and in business. So this is going to load a preview. This is going to load a preview of what you're coding on the left side and like this will show, okay, so the left side is the back end and the right side is the front end. Everything you're typing on the left side will display itself in some shape or form on the front end if you're building the front end view. Obviously like the functions and stuff you won't be able to like see. But as you can see, if I just changed this from hello well to hello mafia, this update in real time and you can see exactly what you are building, which is super cool. So the way I usually like to start building apps is kind of mapping up the design first and you know people can say that this isn't necessarily productive but I like to do it because it gives me a vision of what the app is and that inspires me to and motivates me to keep building, keep building, keep building. Whereas if you're just working on a feature and the rest of it isn't built, you might be like, eh, I'm not super happy with this but if you start creating a brand around it and start doing the designs, it feels more real and more tangible and that pushes you to keep building. At least that's how I operate. So I'm going to start with like fontway.bold.font.title and if you watch this tutorial I suggested earlier like these concepts are really easy to understand. I'm not going to go into details on how to code but I will kind of give you a little bit about kind of what I'm doing where necessary. So okay, so that's the title. We'll do a spacer and then we'll do a button with the label of an image and this is when you opened SF symbols. I told you guys down at this earlier. So open SF symbols and we're going to go for a camera icon. So what do camera.circle? Is there a circle.fill? Let's see circle.fill. Okay, there is. So I'm going to copy this, this name and I'm going to do image system name. Actually I'm going to make this a bit bigger for you guys. Image system name, camera.circle.fill. So as you can see time the little circle in the corner now. Great. Now we'll do dot resizable. Scalpel to fit. Frame.Witth. I'm going to say width 45. Is that big enough? No. 90? Okay, I mean I'll do like AC. It's a fine balance. That's all good and then for the color I'm going to go red. Cool. Like a little like camera red recording icon which is sick. Okay, now inside this, inside this bracket you do the logic which will get to very very soon. So what this should do is you click on this it will then open your camera and there should be another button where you can click and snap a photo. That photo should then be sent back to the chat TbT API and then that will analyze the calories and estimate it and then you'll take that data that chat TbT is analyzed also where it's like estimate the calories and display that on the front end for the user. So that's our objective today and then we'll get into the pay all the energy I'll soon. So let's stop billing us. So what I would do is take this logic. Actually we'll just copy that entire file. Then we go to chattbt.com. Now close this. Hey chattbt. I'm coding a calorie tracker app and I want you to write me the code for a function that allows me to press the button shown below. Pull up the camera and when a photo is snapped it should send it back to the JGPT API and estimate the calories and also display the name of the food item it sees. Don't use any packages just use a standard API call and then I'm going to send it my code. Maybe I could have written this better but it doesn't have to be perfect. If you ask a question and it fucks up or isn't the result you're expecting you can always go back and say hey can we change this or I meant this thing or I meant to say or explain the bug. If this doesn't work just be like okay look it didn't estimate the calories it estimated the width of the food whatever it is but the prompt doesn't have to be perfect at least that's my tick so I would post this let's see what it says while we wait I'm going to take a civil water. Signed note chattbt.5 takes a hell of a long time to reply it honestly I love for O because it was incredibly accurate and fast so you know it is what it is but apparently the chattbt.5 makes less mistakes and thinks deeper about certain topics so you don't have to keep going back and forth because it did make the occasional mistakes okay this is important. You got to so I'll give you a quick background for Apple you need to clearly state why you're using certain features for example the camera or the microphone or the photo library you need to add and do this with me copy and as camera uses description go to xcode click cally i top left with us what you named it go into info click this plus icon paste it in click return it should then pull up the full name and then you can write we use your camera so you can take a picture of food and estimate the calories bomb you need to do this avoid your camera one work straight up very central okay well send me a massive massive code result and it's all in one file which you know isn't optimal but for the sake of the tutorial I think it's clearer and easier so we're going to stick with this okay it's just finished so I would copy this and not by the way this whole chat will be in the course materials you can go into this and also copy the exact code I'm I'm I'm taking here right now and then copy and paste the entire file back into it and let's see any errors two errors so what I would do is I would copy the errors if you do get them and they are occasional but they do happen I'm just going to show you how to navigate this you'd post I got two errors fix these for me please I'm going to paste the errors and it should know what's causing it like it should have the knowledge and intelligence to find out what is causing it and fix it for us you know what we can do in the meantime we can go to platform.openai.com platform.openai.com making account if you haven't already in the top right there should be a button to create an account okay look as you can see the sign up do that I already have an account so I don't ooh it would lock me up but I will make an incognito by my bad platform.openai.com once you assign then go to I believe manage projects yep API keys and then create a new secret key I'm going to call this one Cal AI clone and just pick the quitter project and this will create a secret key usually you can't reveal this but I'm like I'm going to delete this afterwards but copy the key and make sure you paste it into whoa like into this your your open AI API key so we'll do that right now that's how China GBT knows which account to build so incredibly important and you won't be able to do a function call about it that's very important to know as well okay let's get back to all right so sending back the full fixed file which means we're going to need to paste in the open AI key again but that's not an issue takes like a second by the way I intend to keep this process very broad and uncut just because like this is like the real grind you are seeing like directly behind the scenes of the building process and like if I do fast cuts a lot of you guys won't understand and I think it's very important to see the building process in its floors in its successes I kind of kind of adjust of how long it takes but we'll always prove this like eventually once it gets it right that's like the bulk of the work all right cool hopefully this work was hopefully this works so paste it in and no errors great all right now let's go back to our API key copy it and then paste it in the your opening API API such tongue twister your opening AI API key all right paste it in bomb and run of ships running to my phone oh no okay I've just run it on the simulator so let's see how it looks simulators are a little bit different to the preview by the way but I like using the simulator I guess let's test camera bomb camera right there amazing which is great and should work but because it's in the simulator and it has no physical camera you won't be able to see what it's doing so what we should do is run this I guess they great it works now please add functionality to upload stuff from your photo library as well in the meantime I'm going to find a picture of food on the simulator picture of lasagna actually lasagna is like so misleading because everything's like melted together but we'll try it we'll do this this picture it's going to hold down on it click save to photos this is just for the tutorial by the way usually in practice when people have their real phones they could just take a picture very simple but for the safety of the tutorial I will show you how this works okay so it's going to send like the full complete code again is that right seems like it it should be fast at this time because it's only changing a few lines but then we will need to find our API key again I'm going to tell it in future if there are any more changes we need to do after this to just use the API key that I provided but like I hope this is an example of like it's not super complex like yes there's a lot of back and forth from repetition and trying to like mold the AI to do you want but that's the game and once it's built once sorry she's the same word twice once it's built once I suppose you don't need to really build it again there's just slight improvements that you have to make but once I built this feature and I can just change the code slightly to improve it like I don't need to get this entire thing written written written again have to keep going back to AI I just make small changes and will I will say as well once you've built this app this example you can just go out there and market it you don't need to do much else like it can be very simple as long as it helps a select few people and makes their life maybe five to ten percent better that's all that matters and like the distribution of having an AI estimate the calories even if it isn't perfect is super helpful even if it sucks it can suck calie I launched and it launched with one feature and the tracking wasn't great they slowly started improving it but they still made hundreds of thousands of dollars before that point so I wouldn't over index on like getting a technical part I'm you know like I'd focus on just building MVP okay so that should be good and again I'm gonna have to get my API key annoying but hey all good so here we go paste it in run it on the simulator by the way to run I'm using command R so it's the Apple symbol in your keyboard plus let's okay let's see there we go so now I can choose from library and I'm gonna select the that's me I'm gonna select the lasagna and it's saying analyzing boom we have fucking built calie I okay that's how you do it right I'm launching a competitor Blake and Zach and Henry and Jake watch out because my calie I is going to destroy the market I'm gonna make way more money than you and you guys suck look how accurate that is come on now all right awesome boys we have something tangible now there are there are a bunch of improvements and changes you can make how much of it is totally relevant I don't know but like I'm telling you and I know this sucks but you could fully go to market with this product right now and how long did it take me like 17 minutes and that's just with like a bit of back and forth of AI 17 minutes and I've built the main feature that calie made hundreds of thousands of dollars with there we go this is the new age of software boys welcome to the fucking mafia new age okay great now let's go back to our course assignment all right well it looks like that's it for the core feature like we built it boys we have built it and we can do another test real quick just just for reference let's get like ice cream ice cream let's see if this works as well so we're going to images er we'll get this ice cream looks good but if it estimates the hand that would be so funny how many calories do you think are in a hand all right bomb analyzing let's go chocolate ice cream there we fucking go boys okay next module we'll go through the paywall and onboarding and we'll show you guys how to make money and how to turn this free product and easy to use products paywall it and then before the paywall just convince people why this is relevant to them and why they should pay see boys

Alright boys, we're back, minimal cuts, let's get straight back into business. So in this module we'll be going through onboarding and onboarding logic. This is the lead up to getting someone to pay for your subscription. And in my opinion, this is the most important step for consumer apps that are utility and subscription based. For social apps you want to reduce and as opposed to dating, oh well not dating apps, but social apps for sure, you want to reduce the amount of friction because every screen like reduces the amount of people that will convert to the end. And like if I pull up my logic, sorry, my mix panel, my data and we will get more into this later. But you can see this is my onboarding funnel and yeah, you can see there is drop off. Like only 95% of people converted to the fifth screen from the third screen, from the fourth screen. So usually in most cases you don't want to add this friction but when it comes to trying to prep someone to pay, the more time they spend doing the onboarding answering questions and finding out more about the product, the more likely they are to pay. Whereas like if it was a one or two screen, then you hit with a paywall, it's super easy to close the app, uninstall and just not end up paying. So the friction is incredibly necessary. Also wow, that's a massive drop off. Oh, I know where that is. No worries, it's not actually about how it's just been for the last very days. I introduced a new page, so all the previous guys didn't see it. That's fine. Okay, back to it. So how do we build this from a technical point of view? Now we want a list of questions and answers and we want the flow for the screen to move on to the next question after you answer the previous question and then at the end of it there should be the paywall trigger and then the paywall trigger after you pay you should enter the app. So let's dive straight into the logic. What I'm going to do is make a new file. I'm going to do command N and I'm going to click switch like you. I'm going to call this onboarding view. Okay, so now I'm going to copy this file. Actually what I'm going to do is start and I'm going to open the preview so you guys can see, make it very clear. So hello world. Now I'm going to go back into chat to BT and I'm going to context with, is that the weren't we? Context or communicate or whatever with chat to BT and try and build this funnel. So hi chat to BT, I'm building an onboarding funnel that asks the user questions about their calorie tracking process and goals. Please make every question somewhat different and build a nurture a relationship so they can convert pay at the end of the funnel. Once all screens are answered, display a loading screen, a calculating loading screen and then trigger if empty font that I will build into later. Okay, then I'm going to send it my code. This is kind of prompt I would ask again, it's not probably the most optimal and bleak probably has better prompts but I want to be raw and transparent on how I do it and a little bit about me. I have a successful app. I own Quitzer. We do half a million dollars a month. I coded a lot of it myself. So I know what I'm doing for the most part and even if it seems like I don't know what I'm doing, well look how far it got me so I'm going to share it anyway. Okay, well that was a very quick one. Let's sip some water but I guess not. This is great. I can already tell. This is great. This first question is asked. Maybe later. You don't want to ever give the option to do it later. That sucks. We'll change it to a different question. Progress bar. Okay, progress bar at the top. Question view. This is great. The functions. So this function just like pushes you to the next step to the next question. It just adds an animation. Kinders. Again, it's doing it all in one file which I think for the tutorial was really simple. Long term you want to switch to the MVVM structure which is model view model and they had three separate files. But again, this isn't like a technical masterclass. This is how to build an app from scratch and how to build something that's been successful in the past. And then just as soon as you built it, just go out there and do some marketing because you can market and make money from almost anything. Although of course, make sure you're putting up good quality stuff. I don't suggest you just putting up sloth and trying to make money. I suggest you try and help people or help the niche. And that is like the key to being successful. Okay, so we're just going to copy and paste this in. Hopefully this works. First try, baby. Okay, welcome to Kaliai. I'll tailor you to this. Sounds good. Let's do it. Continue. Bro, this is amazing. This is great. Let me see if you click this. Okay, it doesn't matter. Let's do it. I'm just going to change this to. I can't wait. Let's go. Just for simplicity. Obviously I won't actually put this. I can't wait. Let's go. All right. So the whole point of this, oh, should I be going to load? Bra. Wow. That is crazy long. I'm just going to run this myself. My bad. Okay. So as I was saying, the whole point on boarding is to like answer the user's questions because you need to convince them on why paying for Kaliai is a good idea before they get hit the screen and then they're like, should I, if I can pay or should I leave? So you're supposed to answer all of his questions beforehand and convince them. So when they do get hit with the pay, they're like, huh, but actually I answered a bunch of questions and I believe in this and I really want to get started. I'm super motivated. Boom impulse by unsubscribeer. Let me use this product. So we'll go through this. Boom. Where are you starting from? Tiddle beginner. Which primary goal? These fact. I just like multiple. Okay. Now, primary goal. Okay. Cool. What's your target pace? Boom. Simple. How do you want to track photo estimate? This is great. How many workouts a week? This is a bit of a random question. But hey, when you can input stuff, I love pizza, but I know I shouldn't. Boom. Finish. Calculate in your plan. This is the key. You need to have the app think about the answers and results because that makes it look more legit. That is the key. That is the key. Okay. And at this point, after it's calculated, the plan should pump the paywall, which goes on to our next topic, which is super. So let's get into super wall and we will show you how to make money from your product.

Alright boys, welcome to the monetizing part of the course. I will pretty much be running through how the paywall works, getting it fully set up, when to trigger it and how to collect the best amount of information data you can so you can make better informed decisions when it comes to A.B. testing pricing and paywalls and products etc. So, okay, this all starts with installing this package which will be linked in the document. So, just come to this 3.2.3 slide and copy it. Got an Xcode, on the left side right click and click add package dependencies. Then paste in the top right corner the super wall and then click add package. And then we're going to do this wait for this to load. Make sure this added to the Cal AI target or whatever you call your app and then click add package. Born, that's solid. Then what you want to do is go to super wall.com and make an account. I already have an account, by the way this these steps suck. I usually make around 15 thousand dollars a day but I think super had a bug and we lost like 30% of our revenue which sucks but it happens sometimes. But yeah, once you're in it should put you for an onboarding process but you should get to this page eventually. I'm going to make a brand new project. I'm going to call this Cal AI and then the app name I'm just going to call it Cal AI. Oh this is new, not it released yet. And then com. I believe I call it mafia.cal AI. Make sure this is accurate though. You can check this by going top left general. Mafia tutorial. Cal AI. Okay, make sure you copy that word for word. Cal AI. Boom and then click create app. We are in. So you're going to see zero dollars per se zero and you use this etc. Very very obvious why it's zero. I'd go to settings. Actually you know go to quick start. Make sure you check this off because you've installed the SDK. Configure the SDK. Okay, so to configure the SDK make sure you copy this and we'll import super cool. Okay very soon. What you want to do is go to Cal AI underscore app or whatever your app is called. Click import super wall kits and then under struct copy exactly what I'm doing in it and then in it the super configuration. What this does is as soon as your app loads up it initiates your API key and links it to super wall. So now it's pulling all of the paywalls you've made and allowing you to use them on the front end for your code which is very crucial. So make sure you do that after you present after I read in the word after you've set that up make sure you present a paywall. So copy this example and you will understand what I mean. So what we're going to do is we're just going to make a brand new file. I'm going to call this paywall view. I'm going to add a new button. So I'm going to turn this into a B stack first and foremost. B stack text, paywall, and then button, the label of open paywall. And then I'm going to paste in this make sure super wall is actually imported so import super wall kit. And now this is what super is doing when I paste this in. Anytime someone clicks the open paywall button is going to communicate with the backend and your super wall account and then pull whatever paywall is linked to this placement which is campaign trigger. Sounds confusing, this should work. Okay, so this is an example paywall and I will go through linking a product. So this would have a price right here and as soon as someone clicks continue they are prompted to pay and once they have paid they get access to the app and that is really simple. So think about the pieces we have now. We have the onboarding view which allows someone to answer questions and figure out why this app is good for them. After the results have been calculated they then presented with the paywall view and then they have to decide to themselves okay I just answered a bunch of questions I've learned more about myself, about my goals about the app. Should I pay this 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 40 bucks a year? If the answer is yes to that question and they do end up paying then they get prompted with uh oh preview. Oh shit wrong side, wrong side, wrong side. Clonset view. After they paid they are presented this, this, this, wow can be built. Way to ruin my recording but often they appear they are essentially presented with the main app which is what we just built in Estimate and the calories and allowing you to take a photo of your food etc. Very simple stuff. So those are the free like extremely essential components and once you have that you can easily go out into the market and start selling a product making money for sure but there's some pre-reducts we need to do so let's do that. So let's think. Okay so let's go to App Store Connect and start building these products so we can share it with Superwall and allow you to monetize. So I would make a new app from App Store Connect, new app. We're going to call it Cal AI. Choose the language of English US if that is your main region. I'm going to click the... Huh. It's not showing. It's confusing. Okay anyways I'm going to call it App name Cal AI. English US if that is your main region and then we are going to select the bundle ID for some reason mine isn't showing but I can always change it later and then call this Cal AI or whatever else you want to call it and then just click full access and then make sure iOS is selected at the top. We'll click Create. Okay Cal AI has taken my pad Cal AI mafia test. Okay cool now your app is made on the App Store and of course we're going to go through this later and optimize it in another module but we'll go to subscriptions. You click Create Subscription group you call this Superwall and we're going to make our first subscription. I'm going to call this yearly. The product that is going to be yearly 30 and we'll click Create. Availability is going to be the entire world and the subscription price I'm going to say of like 2999 which is like a solid most optimal price for this app and that's based off all the testing Zach and his team have done over the past year. Later we will go through how to like really reopt my Superwall and make a bunch of different products put those products into paywalls and then AP test that and try and find like the highest LTV the highest average order value etc etc but final just make one product the localization this doesn't really matter we're just going to call yearly yearly subscription to Cal AI. Okay great and then we'll click Save and that should be fine actually I think we need an image for some reason they still make you do this very confusing very very confusing but we'll add an image we'll just copy this and drag that in. Okay great now this has to be submitted for review and of course we can't submit it for review until the app is finished so upon launch I don't think you'll be able to monetize your app I think you need to wait at least like one version cycle so let's see release 1.0 and 1.1 you can release the in that purchase for some reason I don't know why Apple does this I don't know why they need to even review subscriptions and pricing it just seems like a complete waste of time but hey that's how they do it the most important thing you need to do here is copy this yearly first the product ID and for every subsequent and future subscription you create the product ID is how super will will super wall will identify this on the back and with App Store Connect so what we're going to do is go to Super wall and clicking next next and then adding products on the left hand side so click add products paste in the product ID and then select the price and trial and period so we did 29.99 so we'll select that the period is the year and we'll click safe so now this is our first product this isn't like fully registered because Apple need to approve it but we can now use it to test our paywalls and fuck her out so that's great so we'll go into paywalls we'll click into this paywall and then on the left hand side click products and then for the primary we'll just click the 29.99 zone a year then we can remove the tertiary and secondary and bomb we are good just click save and publish some top right so as you can see it's now pulling the pricing it says 29.99 a year only 2.49 a month now when people click the big blue button they are prompted to pay using Apple pay for your app and that should be fleeced up which is great okay cool okay all right so now we're going to put this all into practice let me run you through the exact flow how we're going to put it together and how this will work holistically so first we're going to go to Cali app make sure on-boarding view is the first one I think for this example this is very clear after the on-boarding view and after it's been calculated let's see when it's been calculated so it runs this command which is on done on done is triggered okay on done finalize on-boarding so we'll find this and then we will do superwall.shared.presentview actually let me just copy it's a registered placement not presentview we'll paste that in here and then we'll import superwall kit and now we'll do this actually just just for example we'll add state bar private bar clicked pewall equals false so now if this has been clicked because usually we can't test out superwall until they improve the product so if this has been clicked we will do if pewall clicked if what was it again if clicked pewall equals false we'll trigger this else if clicked pewall equals true actually you know should just be else this and then if else it should present the content view so we'll do that before that works we need to make sure click the pewall dot toggle great okay we'll just do this and then open pewall wait okay so now we should be this if clicked pewall equals true navigation link label access app and the navigation link should link to the main view which is content view okay so now this should work this is like the full package right here so we'll have it on warning so welcome to Kalaiar tell us to use this sound good yes let's do it where am I starting from I'm a total what's my primary goal to lose fat what's my target pace I'm gonna say balanced how do you want to track I want to do photo estimates you'll take targets fucking sick I want to play around with it typical weak day activity I'd say some movement not that much but some movement how many workouts do I do a week I do fucking zero I don't know what I'm doing what tricks you up the most probably late actually weekends I just drink drink drink drink and I get nowhere and I become fat that's what I do any do's I love or hate I hate tuna okay if we nail this what changes first look cleaner feel more confident more into your focus oh this is very intentional language and I kind of created charge you be to give this kind of response but like showing them the transformation of like okay if this app works out what happens I get more energy focus I become more confident I look cleaner I perform better in training like these are all direct results so when you're prompted with a pay all for like 2999 a year you're like fuck yeah I get all of this and all I gotta do is pay 30 bucks now it is slightly misleading because it's still up to the person to make those changes in their own life like the app just because you pay doesn't mean it's gonna like fucking transform overnight it still takes a time and dedication and grip but this language really helps sell the product so then you click finish calculates your plan boom you get hit with the paywall not obviously this is a little bit fast they would change it up at the end but this is just for demonstration purposes hits you with the paywall so now that trigger is done let's hyperfittingly say I click continue and I pay obviously we have this error because we can't find the product yet which is totally fine obviously expected that you click x out and now you see access app oh can I click it click it damn it's probably because that's in front but let's say you did click it and you did pay what would happen now well you guessed it we're in the fucking app we paid for it we're in and now I can take a picture of my lasagna and cal ai will estimate the calories and it's doing exactly what I paid for it works like a charm so you see everything we've just done in under like an hour has built us a product that has an onboarding that convinces a user to finally pay we have a paywall that prompts the user to actually pay with a price that we can AB test etc and after the user is paid they have access to the app and now they can use it and it works and everyone's happy you've just made money you just provided a great product experience and now people are using your app to better their lives congrats everyone we did it now obviously this is not the end of the tutorial I'm going to get way more in depth with like building a way more polished products but that's just kind of like the service level of what we're building here this is more of a demonstration how easy it is there is more technical components in order to like log the subscription to track the data to make sure that actually looks good to ask the right questions and I will be running through that but that's like the main public tutorial just to show you how I got from zero to hero I finally have a product that I could actually sell and even without like the paywall logic you could probably fucking sell this by the way all the get hub links and all the code links will be in the description or in the document so find that and yeah the next part of this let's see what we're going through so we'll be going through database setup which I'd say is important I'll get back to it analytics final cleanup and optimizations I'm going to spend a lot more time on the cleanup and optimizations to show you how to build like an actual solid robust app but yeah that's it for this congrats guys good shit

Hey everyone, welcome back to the development module. Today we'll be going through cleanup and optimizations to the app we previously built, which is a Calais competitor. So I've gone out and done the courtesy of building and refining the app for you. The reason I did this off camera is because I feel like it's a better use of my time to just explain and show you how to do the higher revenue level pulling items rather than just copy pasting code that I've just taken from Quitter. So this is the new app. We have a splash screen, we now have a welcome view. The tutorial is relatively the same. I've just changed it a little bit of logic. But like all the code will be in the app Mafia document. You guys should be able to download this and you should be good to go. So skip quiz will bring us to a new page which asks your name. This is very important to make the app feel more personal and also your age. So this age is extremely important because we're going to be sending you to a different paywall or triggering a different paywall every like depending on your age group. And as I explained previously or maybe I explained it later on. Yeah, it might be a few lessons ahead in the super lesson. But pushing a user down a different paywall shows you the data on conversion rates for the demographic which helps you make better informed decisions when it comes to marketing because if you can see under 18s are converting like trash. You're not going to work with creators or run ads towards people that are under 18. Whereas like if you see that the demographic of 28 to 30 is doing extremely well the code to convert your rates extremely high. You'll be more it'll be more beneficial for you to put more eggs in that basket rather than under 18s. So collecting it here is very important. I've done all the logic for you but we will I will run through and explain how we'll set up different campaigns for different age groups. So yeah let's finish. I've also added a choose your goals thing. This just adds a little bit more friction a little bit more intentionality which helps conversion right at the end. We calculate I probably should add a few more slides and I probably will. You'll see in the get hub it might be slightly different. But again I'm going to explain you the high high revenue level pulling things we can do so you can make more money in your onboarding and we'll be building that out together. So now it's just complete you get a chart. This is very important rate the app. The more five stars it has in the app store the more trust you build. We also have this screen now which is welcome to Cali eye you're path to healthy eating based on your answers we've built a plan just for you. It's designed to help you lose 25 pounds in 90 days. So you're setting the target and expectation straight away. Now it's time to invest in yourself. Boom your custom plan is ready and this get get get started button should open the paywall but we haven't built the logic so let's build the logic. So first off when it says Alex your custom plan is ready I'm going to copy this stuff. Custom plan. So you should come pay will be right. Paywall. Paywall view okay we'll put this here and instead of saying Alex I'm just going to make it say backward bracket name. This should pull the name from whatever you put during the onboarding. So that's great user name actually. Okay so now instead of saying Alex will dynamically change based on what the user put in again this will all be in the get up code but let's build the logic for the let's get started button. Let's get started. This triggers view controller or press button and then the brackets. This links to a like this links to backend logic where it checks the user's age based on what it inputted during the onboarding and if it's you know below 22 it will put you in the 18 to 22 category. If it's below 28 or put you in the 23 to 28 category. If it's below 40 or put you in the 29 40 category and you can change this however you like if I want to have a broader age range I might go to 26 and then change or change this to 24 and change this to 26 and that will capture a smaller and more nuanced age range and of course like the that gives you better data on like which age range has the most revenue you can even thumb it down to like the actual age so instead of an age range we can just go 18 19 20 21 22 and maybe 22 has a 5% conversion rate over 21 and so it actually makes more sense to invest in 22 but we'll keep it how it was before I think it was completely fine. Now this is the most important part you see versus placement this is the event that you trip on super wall so if you're happy with these age ranges and we're going to do it for the sake of the tutorial we're just going to copy these placement names go into arc or whatever browser you're using go into the super wall go into campaigns and then start a new campaign we're going to call this under 18 we'll start under 18 and then top left by placements you click the plus the blue plus button you click select and you just paste in the name so under 18 add placement and then we'll go into paywalls add a paywall and then I guess we'll just do the example paywall for now and then set this to 100% of users I'm sure 100% removed is 100% from this one okay great now all we can do is we can just believe we just duplicate it right duplicate okay maybe not duplicate we might have to manually do it every single time which is totally fine you just go to new campaign again by the way this is the first one fully set up so now if I set my age is under 18 I will be traded with a paywall and we can test this right now as well let me just uninstall the app I had I have a backend check to see if they've reached the paywall and if they have reached the paywall then it needs to be the onboarding again which is great because if they skip all the questions they usually log back in if they're re-hide tent they're like okay I'm going to pay this time tap the button pay so you don't want to get into the onboarding again because they might just quit and you'll lose that on that revenue so I'll show you proof that this works now so if I set my name as it will change it will click barely my age is 17 so this is under 18 I should be able to see the paywall now right not now next okay that's also hey Alex but I don't think I changed that hey Alex hey Alex will paste in the name here same backward user name and we'll just pull that from the okay let's begin this should say hey Billy now okay yeah Billy your custom plan is ready all right we'll get back to this sorry about that okay so now I should be able to access the under 18 paywall because I set my age is 17 so there we go now it's triggered and this data will be transmuted back to the super-platform and it should if I wasn't on a simulator it should say one uses and if I were to pay it would say $20 and proceeds now this is great and I'll show you quitters break down right here I'm gonna go through this later in a different segment too but if you see quitters break down all the revenue for today is very clear under 18s has likely the most traffic but the least amount of proceeds okay you see that right here but the 23 to 28 range has the highest conversion rate and like the most revenue per user so it's very informative to do this and look we'll just set up the rest of the campaigns so you guys are aware how to do it go back to paywall logic and then 18 to 22 although you can call the campaign anything I usually just do this so 18 to 22 placements top left paste 18 to 22 and then add the same paywall as before or you can change the paywall and change the pricing this is very good when it comes to testing how to maximize revenue and again we go into this in a future segment so save that go back into new campaign this one's 23 to 28 and we'll just copy the placement age 23 to 28 very simple stuff at the paywall again by the way I feel like I'm the first to do this at least in the soup will break down a lot of people send the traffic to the set all the traffic to the same paywall and just hope for the best and I wish I would have done this sooner because ever since I found out that 23 to 28 age range converted the best all of our matter ads were shifted towards that age range we're now super super profitable so you guys are learning the fucking secrets right here right so 29 to 40 entries this is extremely large gap and maybe I recommend you know lowering this but this is what we're gonna do for now example paywall all right and then above 40 is the final one over 40 all right guys you are now fully set up and the app will change the paywall and change the direction of data depending on the age you put in on-boarding massive massive progress good shit so all right that's the first thing that helps you who's revving you that's the first step let's see what else we got we also have showed notification after five minutes okay this is a really fun one I love doing this anytime someone reaches the paywall and they don't convert and of course like the majority will not convert we'll just ping them with notification saying hey Alex whatever name they use during on-boarding like we like you made it so far that you're about to invest in yourself you're about to invest in your new life here's 80% off just in case you are on the edge of buying and you were like uncertain such change might last second this code will copy from quitter I believe 80% if I search that here we go yep so this notification right here so private func schedule notification again this will be in the GitHub code we will trigger this at the paywall so we'll send on appear the first let's build the funk so funk right here and then on-appear schedule notification okay we can remove this this is Firebase we don't need that and yeah so it's it goes username we didn't give up on you limited time offer get 80% off of cal AI and become the healthiest version of yourself and you can say we have an amazing community in 35 plus features this is kind of fluff probably don't need that but this will catch their attention and they will be like okay holy shit I've got to subscribe I was so close to being the best version myself and I've just been reminded I've just pushed this foot in the user's mind that this is the key I need cal AI and so that little notch really helps conversion rates and I can show you from my end what that looks like on the bottom line revenue side of things we call this discount button we show the boss in half the five minutes and it's right here of course the revenue is super low today but like you can just estimate so discount button has a 10% conversion rate and 500 users of the three and a half K view this screen so we make an extra thousand a day or like almost 20% extra a day just by this notification and this discount button on that note let's create the discount button it's right here discount you so we'll just copy the discount view again I'll provide this code in GitHub is a lot of copying pasting discount so it's boring because there's a lot of copy pasting but it's so worth it dot crackdown dot white okay cool looks good and then I'm sure we just put the discount code viewed this kind of code view inside the peal right discount view okay yeah great so we just copied this go into the paywall and put it underneath the main target discount view know what this does is as soon as you view the page it starts counting down from a five minute timer of the five minutes you get hit the notification and you also get hit with a discount button so very flawless logic that's great boost revenue by a thousand dollars a day for us so extra thirty K a month no complaining no complaining um let's also go to what else shortcuts so I love shortcuts um and I'll explain why any time you try and uninstall quitter there's two buttons there's one are you deleting like tell us why send your feedback like let's improve the app for you let's make this experience better and we learn a lot about how i use this feel about our product and continuously iterate and improve to the point where the conversion rate increases because we solve all the problems that people are having in the past now the main um requests we get is that we're too expensive and we shouldn't even monetize an addition etc etc um but having this button shows you care there is a second button but it could be because I've already paid that I don't see it but I could pull it up on my phone and we'll be building it out this is the this is the important button let's see okay I can just show you on my phone so the second button as you can see is try for free so this button once you click it and I'll click it right here we'll open the app and trigger the paywall trigger a paywall that gives you a free child to quitter now all of our apps cali i quitter you max etc are are hard payalled meaning that you can't access anything for free and it's just a funnel to convert you the reason we offer a free trial is because people holding on the app long pressing on the app are usually just going to delete it so as as our last ditch attempt we give them free trial and if they like the product then they stick around and we make revenue from it and I can show you the revenue from quitter's end for what we make in free trials as you can see right here we had 200 people that were about to uninstall but saw the free trial button and then clicked it and then from that we have 20 convergents so around a 10% convergent rate and today we've made 81 dollars now doesn't seem like a lot again there's also like time discrepancy on it which like we have to wait a week or three days I'm not sure but if I change this to the last 90 days we can see how much bottom line revenue is generated and it's done $12,000 in the last 90 days or people that were about to uninstall but ended up staying giving us a try and enjoying the product now of course these people are the most they are the lowest intent they didn't want to invest themselves at first you know they like hesitant stuff free trial and usually they probably have my money but like we still make thousands of dollars off of that small probability so at scale I do totally recommend it I think it's a great idea so let me show you how we built that all right so I've written gpt and I pretty much copied quitter's scene delegate where we trigger the update quick actions button so anytime the app is launched it displays these shortcuts I for instance judge it be to you and it gave us like this complete mess of code which again will be linked below I just pasted it in and it's seemingly working so if we hold down the cali app now there's a deleting tell us why button and a try for free button which is great now we just need to link this back to soup wall and get it fully set up so this quitter let's get back to cali i um all right so here item dot append quick actions so how do I do the action is it down here okay so this is the action so we're going to do soup wall dot shared dot uh what was it soup wall dot shared dot register I don't know why it's called registers where placement we'll pull this free underscore trial and that should be good to go okay great um and then for this one you can do a link to a google form it's very simple how to do that online I can show you how we do it for quitter um okay so this is how we do it for quitter when the actions performed we do open url the code to open url is right here just copy this line and we'll bring it over to cali i as well paste this at the top wait maybe like this okay that works and then when it comes to oh actually it should be like here and then when it comes to sending feedback what you got to do is do open and open url and then link the url so where it should be i believe it's like url on the score value let me pull the exact thing we do open url so yeah this is the code used to url I guess we just paste this at the top as well and then put in your google form so this is the one we used to collect feedback for quitter you can make a google form and put in whatever link you need to here as well um and then just do open url website url and the quick and then the annual plan quick action should register the free trial which will set up and super right now so we'll set up a let's go to cali i and we'll just go to templates oh this one I could free trial ish template something like this i actually like this is better so we use this template we'll pull it free trial free trial you will never see this again etc etc we don't need to add a product you guys can add a product off to the fact um and then we'll create a brand new campaign we'll call this one free underscore trial and we'll also call the placement free underscore trial and then we'll add the brand new free trial paywall so that is the top create changes to a 100% changes to 0% save save relaunch the app so we use command or build succeeded good shit good shit and then if you hold down on the cali app just as you're about to delete it you're from to with two things one you delete and tell us why and this will open the website and the trial for free oh it's not fucking working are you serious right it's not working but we'll fix this right now all right you know what boys i will just add the code to the get hub that works charge evt is having issues right now um but yeah just down at the get hub code everything's linked just make sure you follow the super tutorial on how to set up the campaigns and you should be all good out the box peace out

Hey everyone, welcome back to the development module. Today we'll be going over how to master Superwall. Superwall is the paywall provider and this is how you'll be tracking your revenue per user, your lifetime value, your your AV testing, how many people actually reaching the paywall, testing pricing, etc etc. And it's very essential in order to be really profitable and to improve everything else in the business side of things. So this is less about the product tomorrow about the business side of things. So we'll go straight for it. This is the Superwall dashboard at Superwall.com. I'm already logged in but if you if you're not logged in yet just like create an account, very simple stuff. So I'll run you through the main dashboard. Top left is the proceeds today. So it's the amount of revenue minus Apple's cart whether that be 15 or 30%. They take 30% from me. So my gross today is about maybe 11 or 12k and after their taxes we're sitting at like 8.2k for the day which isn't great but hey like is what it is. That's not fucking important right now. Okay so new users. This is how many people in the last 24 hours have downloaded your app. So about 3.2k. This is how many people have converted in the last 24 hours including free trials. So it can be a bit misleading at times. I have a hard paywall but for under 18s as you can see we have a free trial. So that's why only 200 like 200 conversions which is quite a lot. Only a mass to $700 which is like $3 per user. It doesn't make sense because there's a free trial and yeah very simple stuff. The next one is initial conversions. So how many people down and up within the last 24 hours that ended up paying within the 24 hours. This number here is like like how many people today have converted. They could have downloaded it last week or the week before whatever. So the paywall rate is also very important metric. The paywall rate displays what percent of users that have downloaded your app ended up reaching the paywall. And usually with a long onboarding you can expect a high drop off. You want to be around the 85 to 90% range just like the sweet spot. At the same time I'm not too bothered with 80% because all the people that have low intent and weren't going to buy from anyway would have dropped off. All of these people came to the end and they were super prep to pay and that's why our conversion rate is about 20% which is on the far right side. Get a sip of water real quick. Okay so let's get started. This is Quiddler's breakdown and what we do is we present paywalls by age. So on the back end and I'll show you how to do this as well. We pretty much ask for your age during the onboarding and whatever age you're in will display a custom paywall. Now we don't necessarily change the prices because that might be against their terms of service but what we do do tell what we do do but what we do is we see the conversion rates of different age groups and we didn't do this for a long time but ever since we started doing it I've been learning a hell of a lot more about our demographic and like how much intent there is based on different age ranges. So for example age 23 to 28 seemingly has one of the highest conversion rates at 17.6% paying. So under 18 to have 17.2% but they're free trial. So getting like almost 18% paying is insane and shows that this is the age demographic that we should be focusing on and this really helps it on marketing because let's say we know this is the most profitable niche, most profitable age range. I'm just going to find creators that serve viewers in that age range or I'm going to target Facebook and meta-rads in that age range and eventually be more profitable. Very very simple stuff. What's also interesting to note is under 18s at least for my app so this is very like subjective but for my app most of the traffic comes from under 18s whereas like even though 23 to 28 year olds bring in the most revenue under 18 serve as a massive volume for downloads. All right so now how do you start testing and what are the key metrics to look for when it comes to testing different paywalls of pricing. So the first thing I do when I'm beginning is start out on the template category. So on the left side of Superwall over here there is a botting called templates. Click on to that and look for something that interests you. So what you're looking for is something that appeals to your company. So if it's consumer utility for example I'd copy this one from Homework AI. It's very clear very simple or if it's like a chat based app maybe I choose the step saga this one right here or you know you can make it whatever you want depending on the design of your app, depending on the demographic of targeting, choose anything that interests you. It's not really a big deal. We'll be testing these paywalls anyway so if one doesn't convert we can always test another. We can test a bunch of conjunction and you can find out what's the most optimal for you. So what Super does with these templates by the way is all the successful apps found in paywallscreens.com so they have compiled a bunch of different paywalls. They've also listed the revenue these apps are making. You probably find quitter here I'm sure as well. Yep well it says I'm making 30K a month which isn't true but this is one of our old paywalls and it's like it'll maybe Callie I. We'll use Callie I for this example so it says they're making 200K a month but this is the paywall they were using and you know it's very simple and you can copy it in the template category. So for example the quitter one is right here it's called Capture AI for some reason but it's fine. All you need to do is just click on it and then click use template but because we're doing a Callie I clone I want to make I want to pick a paywall that's kind of better for that so I'm going to choose I think I'm going to do the homework AI one. So scroll back up to the top where homework AI is and click on it click use template super simple. Next it'll show you like a figure I kind of break down of like what all the elements are all you need to do is change the text so I'm going to call this Callie I at the top. Callie I is not pro but we'll keep it and then the bullet points so I'm going to write track calories in one snap. Lose, weight, easy and fast and of course Hunter or Blake would have covered this in the design section but you want to kind of show language where it's like okay I'm reading this paywall screen this app is going to change my life I'm going to track calories I'm going to lose weight easily I'm going to become the best version of myself all I've got to do is pay 20 dollars a year and if you can convince that across then you're going to be super successful but again like we're going to show you how to test these different paywalls so you're not working in the dark I always recommend striving for data so that's exactly what we're going to be doing. So look I picked a paywall I'm going to pick a product product so product also contains a price so they kind of make the same thing so I'm going to choose like let's say 499 a week or secondary maybe 1499 a month and I'm curious like which one's going to convert the most like what what product is going to sell the most very simple just save this go to campaigns create new campaign and let's call it paywall test next thing I want to do is click on to no paywalls add paywall and then just add the most recent one so it's the homework AI template so now that's showing to 100% of users and the results breakdown will be on this category so what I want to do now is make a more informed decision so how do I do that I go back to templates oh sorry I go back to paywalls I click this duplicate button right here duplicate and then I just duplicate it I'm going to call this 2999 a year test of course by the way you need all of these products already built out in App Store Connect which I'm sure you had to do in a previous step so all you need to do is go back to App Store Connect go back to subscriptions and then create a new subscription and then and like just write whatever price you want to test let that get approved by Apple takes probably less than a day then you can use it in Super Wall and start testing pretty simple stuff so okay now we completely duplicated the paywall so this minimizes other factors so for example if I were to test a different paywall design with a different price than I'm playing with two factors maybe the original homework AI template would have been better because of the pricing but because I change the design on this one this performs better makes sense so even though the pricing is cheaper and that everyone is looking at the ARPU and they're like oh the average revenue per user is actually increased because you've had an additional factor you're not going to have a clear answer on what is going to what is the most optimal paywall setup for you but anyways back to the products I'm going to change the product to 2999 a year and then I'm going to keep the monthly price and oh actually I'm going to do the weekly price because it's more manageable now it's like okay you can pay 499 a week which adds up to like $20 a month or you can pay 2999 and get the entire year so this is the great test and because you're kind of covering all areas and you'll find that very fast like what your demographic is and what they were pay for what they were afford so bomb we say that and go back into campaigns go to the new one called paywall test and then just click add paywall and select the brand new 2999 a year test or whatever you call it now usually I would do an 8020 split if I have a pre-existing successful paywall because I don't want to mess up revenue too much but because these are fresh brand new I'm willing to do 5050 and see which out of the 50% of traffic generates the most revenue so I just click save save again and bomb now anytime you run this campaign so by the way so you've got to do placements and this is where you call a campaign name so I'm going to call it paywall test for example create paywall test and whenever you call that in the Call AI code so suple.prison and shared up register so you have to make sure this now says make it bigger paywall test and you'll see when we get back to coding later that this will now display this campaign with the split testing and now anyone that downloads the app will see the either these two paywalls okay great that's the setup now what you want to do is wait for the data to start rolling in so you can make a better informed decision about which one you want to keep and then you can drive more traffic to a different one and then you can do additional additional more tests very simple again I would suggest maybe different design this time rather than different pricing so if you've tested the pricing now it's time to test design and I'd pick something completely different maybe something that has a graphic on it maybe something that feels more engaging like this for example and then we change the text to track calories did it did it and then we changed the pricing maybe we offer free trial whatever whatever whatever pretty simple I've explained the steps you can just choose which product you prefer and then do the same thing go back into campaigns go back into paywall test go into paywalls and just add this brand new paywall and then click the click the pen change the amount of people you want to see the new paywall and boom let the data start rolling in what I would recommend is wait for like a thousand users you okay usually at my scale I'd wait for like a thousand to maybe three thousand users to make a decision wherever paywall is good what's not good is if you make a decision based on limited data so for example if I have extremely high quality traffic like I've nurtured I've like paid an influence a lot of people trust this influencer and now they have a bunch of traffic coming in that is really high intent and then this paywall is of course doing super super well like how much of that can you attribute to the traffic rather than the actual paywall so this is why you should wait an extended period of time before coming to conclusions about what is the most optimal setup for you and I would never get stagnant I would always be testing I'd always be trying new things because like at my scale now so I make half a million dollars a month like a small 10% increase is 50 thousand dollars of additional bottom line revenue every single month so that's just some perspective and 10% on a 20 dollar plan is an extra two dollars like it seems very marginal or nominal but it adds up big time and an extra 10% at Calais level is like half a million to 350 thousand dollars a month so just an example so yeah I'm going to show you now how to study the data and how to make the informed decisions and of course I can't load a bunch of data to this because I'm not going to launch this paywall but I can show you some tests I've ran and how I justify what is doing well what isn't doing well so we'll go to the 50 off that discount button and we have three different tests well we have two tests so we'll look at both of these so one of the tests is you open a special gift it's very like engaging super super engaging and then you click claim your limits it off and out the other one is getting hit straight with a one-time offer very clean you have a countdown on the screen counting down from five minutes clean your off and out and yeah let's see if there's a pricing difference as well no the same price but these are the tests so just a design test and we'll go to the results tab and you can see very clearly the different results so if we ignore this one let's just let's just do these two so focus on the ones that are checked the one with the the present is making like 10% to 15% less than the instant one-time offer with five-minute countdown you see that and that's because I'm judging the ARPU which I believe is the most important metric because this means how much revenue are you generating per viewer so like let's say 10 people viewed a screen and you know one paid $20 you're making $2 per view which is about exactly what this is making so on that note if your goal is revenue getting the ARPU up as much as possible even if it if that means the conversion rate suffers is an issue so you can see there's like a free percent difference between this conversion rate and the other conversion rate between this discount so this seems better and it actually is better sorry that it actually is better has a higher conversion rate and it makes more money per user which kind of makes sense because if you have a higher conversion rate usually more people are paying which means it's more revenue per user so actually yeah no this is right but in some instances like this top one and I know we have limited data but this is an 8.7% conversion rate so very low compared to the others but it has 2.24 estimated dollars revenue per user very interesting stuff so even though this is almost half it's still making more than the previous one so again to cut for if you're optimizing for revenue if you're trying to make as much money as possible focus on ARPU even if that means are the expense of the conversion rate even if that means like you sell $100 a year and only 5% of people pay for it but you make way more money per user because if you had if you were selling like $5 a week plan you would have maybe a super high conversion rate because your average revenue per user wouldn't be that high which means it it maps out that the $100 a year would be way more beneficial for you if you're focusing on revenue actually just forgot massive massive massive thing I'm going to tell you guys one sec all right looking we're not done I'm about to make you thousands of dollars more a day at scale or at least boost your revenue by 20 to 25 to 40 percent is that drastic boys it's that drastic ready you see this top campaign transaction abandoned right here yeah so this has a 25 or 23.1 percent conversion rate that means one in four people pay when they see this screen that's how overpowered it is so I'm going to tell you what it does how to set it up and a really good pay all for it okay let's go so what you do is you go to campaigns you campaign and you search you just call this what transaction abandoned I'm going to call it transaction abandoned two because I already have one and then for placements you do transaction abandoned okay so this is a default super wall event name and you don't need to make it yourself and you can already see the amount of people that triggered this event the last 24 hours which is approximately 2000 people now what this means is anyone that's clicked on the paywall and has clicks continue and like Apple have prompted them to pay and then and then they change their mind and tap out of it yeah they get hit with a second paywall which has a massive discount and it's usually around 50 percent now these people are extremely high intent because they were about to pay maybe you don't know why they didn't pay but maybe pricing was an issue so the whole strategy I've made this campaign which I'll show this one is to hit them with like a phoma offer so this is my phoma offer one time offer 80 percent off forever and very intentional language this offer won't be there once you close it you see this right here very very intentional now what this does is you know imagine imagine the flow someone's about to pay for the Kali AI clone we just created and they really want to check their colors they really want to change their life they really want to lose weight but then they get hit the paywall and they're like okay 30 dollars a year let's do it let's do it click continue and then the the dollar sign comes up on the screen it says 2999 Kali AI and this is double tap to pay and then the users like hmm actually it seems like a lot of money and I don't really spend money on apps I only spend money on food and other stuff so I'm gonna tap out of this as soon as they tap out of it they get hit the one time offer 80 percent off forever all right and it's it just hits some of the fact discount so yeah I mean as the numbers don't lie I've spoke to Zach who owns Kali AI it's boosted their revenue by almost 40 percent it's been my main revenue driver every single day and it's probably the most essential part of Superwall if you want to be successful long term one of the best decisions I've ever ever ever made so I'm real quick I'll just show you with a template you can use for that so if you go to templates um scroll down this should be one okay here's one for example uh this is a bunch of code but it does actually count down and you can kind of go to ideas on one time offer just use this template and then add it to the campaign like I've showed you previously or this is another one one time offer you'll never see this again with a massive discount and I would always discount by at least like 50 percent so the main paywall is like the main paywall presents you with a product that costs 2999 a year the discount gives you an offer for 1999 a year which is you know about 50 percent so yeah anyways that is a high level overview I think I've covered all bases when it comes to Superwall this is like this I guess the most important and essential stuff I wouldn't overcomplicate it it's just you know products paywall pricing testing data and then you make a decision and I would recommend you just keep testing keep testing keep testing um there's always ways to optimize the revenue I think I said it's previously but like a 10 percent increase like taking an LTV over user from 20 $20 to $22 is a 10 percent increase which seems nominal which seems marginal but I'm making half a million a month so a 10 percent increase is $50,000 a month and it goes like the same way for like Cali are like if they boost like conversions or boost like revenue by 10 percent by just playing around with the paywall and the language and how they are framing things that 10 percent increase is hundreds of thousands that's a fucking Lamborghini Hurrah could even a month just in like small really easy um changes so yeah as I said cover all my bases here it is a pretty high level overview but this is all the important stuff and you know I've come this far I mean I'll show the revenue just just because I don't really care this is proceeds by the way all that fucking sucks right 90 days give me something to do see all right almost a million in the last 90 days it was better than this we're having a slow month point is you know I've come this far with all the knowledge I just showed of you and as you can see transaction to pendant has made miles more than any other campaign I've ever run just for perspective so yeah keep killing your boys much love peace

Hey everyone welcome back to the development module today we'll be talking about how to master adjust. Adjust is a tool that I use to track revenue from ads, send out affiliate links to X creators and also see which channels are bringing in the most revenue when it comes to traffic. This tool is great but it takes a hell of a lot of time to set up. I had to get several devs, I had to get so many independent people to help me set it up so we won't be going over that today sadly but I will be showing you how to use it and how to be the best fucking like data guy for your company using adjust. So let's get right into it. The website is adjust.com and I haven't account I've already set everything up so again I will be going over how I use it in my day-to-day operations when it comes to Quissa. So this is the full dashboard overview. I don't know what this time period is this is seemingly the last month or two months and it says we've generated 1.1 million dollars of revenue because we passed the revenue that we generate in the app back to adjust so it just displays on the front and here it shows us the installs we don't have to track this manually this gets tracked automatically this is great and yeah this is very something stuff that you see in a bunch of other platforms but we'll get straight into the meat and potatoes. Let's go to campaign lab and custom links. So anytime we put a blog out anytime we send out a link to an influencer to put in that bio anytime we walk even x affiliate page to post the quid a link in the comments we send them an individual tracking link and you can see a bunch of names here these are campaigns so like there are 77 campaigns within the influencer channel and then you can see all of the influencer names under here and the way we structure this is anytime we want to create a new link let's say it's an x affiliate or affiliate program you would click in the top right new link you will call the channel x affiliates we'll call this test for example you click next next again next again next and then create link. Boom you create an x affiliate link now if we want to send this to specific pages and see the ROI instead of just seeing the whole entire channels ROI we will go to test at the bottom click on the campaigns you campaign link and we'll do the influencer name as like let's just say this pages hourly ship host which is a real account that we partner within the past we'll go next next next next next create link and now anytime the hourly ship host guy uses this link we will be able to see the revenue he's generated for our business so it just makes the whole you know data data part really really simple when it comes to apps usually you don't know what you're doing Apple limits a lot of the traffic data because they're so privacy focused so tools like adjust really make it simple to see the truth and everything it doing so yeah I would send this link to an influencer tell him to use that and then when you go back into the dashboards and the overview you will see a start to accumulate under campaign name so for example an influencer we've walked over the past moon we can see the he's generated 3.2k in the last two months and that's just for his link alone and you can see the same different revenue breakdowns for everyone else we've worked with specifically like socials so this is our main accounts unknown is obviously not tracked we also have all of these meta ads so you can see these are made like 50,000 for 20,000, 26,000 and yeah like adjust is a no-brainer when it comes to breaking down exactly what traffic is bringing and what revenue so you know how to and where to invest all your money back into and you know what like that is the main thing I'll use it for I'll be honest maybe there are other things but I use it for the affiliate links and I absolutely love it and I suggest as you can see blogs and this should be way more than one K which is weird but we have individual links for individual things we do so the main website has a has a custom link I think this is this link 63 installs that does not seem right anyways we have one link for the main website and then for the blogs and the SEO we have another link and you can see that this is generating way more traffic than the main page so instead of like for example instead of giving the same link to the entire website and just like assuming that the entire website is doing well you can attribute it to a specific part of the website for example the blogs we know blogs are doing very well and have brought in 50 thousand dollars for example instead of just the domain bringing 50K so you want to get really specific and you want to just get diving just diving there and like improve everything and then we also have the settings so the app settings once you go into here you want to click into social sharing preview and you want to make this a very clear CTA for example mine's called Quitter Quippoint now join this should be a million people well great for spotting that guys good stuff join a million people on that mission to Quippoint today download now from the up store and Google play and then we have a really sick image and anytime this link is shared on social media this entire preview is shown and this serves kind of like a converting landing page so yeah that's adjust pretty simple stuff I didn't want to dive too deep into it it is very confusing and complex and there's a lot of shit going on I stick to essentials I use it for links cost links and I also use it for ads and then the final thing about the sharing preview is very important to get right for Cali I for example you can call it say download Cali on the app so today join 10 million other people checking their calories on the iPhone or App Store which is very very clear that there's an app specifying that it's an app is very beneficial when it comes to converting people because they don't know if there's a product they hate buying physical products they hate if it's a service they hate services they just want an app that makes it really easy to download that makes it really easy to convert hope that's very clear you know I might re-record this tomorrow who knows I am tired but I will say I did cover a lot of the essentials and if you guys need help setting up a just they have full support team when it comes to setting up your demo but yeah good shit boys

Welcome to the distribution section of the course. I'm Zach. I'll be leading you through the beginning part and then Connor will take over halfway through. We'll actually be switching off. He's gonna, yeah, what you'll see. But this is, if not the most important, one of, it's up there, like top one or two, the most important things of this entire course. You could have the best app in the world, the best ever. If you have zero distribution, you will get zero downloads and you will get zero sales, zero dollars in revenue. And we're not here just to build good apps. We're here to make money. So let's dive in and see how we're gonna do that. So the main distribution channels are really influencers doing influencer marketing, creating organic content. So this is posting on TikTok, Instagram, X, Reddit, anything that's organic. You're not paying for the posters, putting it up, letting the algorithm decide if it's gonna go viral. Paper click ads. This is Facebook ads, Google ads, Snapchat ads, meta ads. Meta actually includes Facebook and Instagram. And then a bunch of others. Then we have App Store Optimization. And this is if you guys are familiar with web apps, web development, the concept of SEO, search engine optimization. This is App Store Optimization or App Store ASO. App Store Optimization, yeah. Okay, App Store search that's incorrect. I'm gonna fix that. But it's App Store Optimization. And this is like keywords. So if you look for my app, Cali, the calorie tracking out, if you look up calorie tracker, the fourth search term will come up as Cali. So that's Apple search optimization or sorry, App Store Optimization. So everything is a trade off. If we look at the profitability curve, paper click ads are the least profitable influencers are the second least profitable. This is all generally, by the way, you might find that for you, it's totally different. But generally, this is what you'll find. Organic content is the second most profitable. And App Store Optimization is the most profitable. And this is really because App Store Optimization, it's just, it takes setup in the beginning when you first launch your app, you're just putting in the keywords, a bunch of things with the title and screenshots. And then it just goes, you're not spending money on this. If someone looks up your search term and goes to your app, you make money, you don't pay for anything. So it's the most profitable. Paper click ads, that's like you're directly paying one of these algorithms to find you a customer that's gonna go by your app. So you're paying to the least margin. Usually it's the greatest customer acquisition cost. Okay, now you go through the scalability curve. And you'll notice there's an inverse relationship between these two where the most profitable is the least scalable here and the least profitable is the most scalable Apple search optimization. App Store Optimization, fuck dude, least scalable, organic content, second least scalable, influencers, second most scalable and paper click ads, the most scalable. This is also everything here. Keep in mind is in general, you might find that it's similar for you. And by scalability, I mean, how hard it is to exhaust the channel, how many daily downloads or monthly downloads, can you pull from these channels? You'll be able to pull the most monthly downloads from paper click ads and the least from App Store Optimization generally. And it's at its peak performance. Okay, now there is the difficulty to start curve. Asso is by far the easiest to start. When you set up your app, you just have to keep a few principles in mind when you're designing your icon, your screenshots, your title, your subtitle and your keywords. So we're going to go through all of those, but really easy. And once you set it up, it's just good forever pretty much. Some people like to go in and change things, but we'll get to all of that. Organic content that it's a pretty steep pickup after App Store Optimization, then it goes to organic content where this, it's not that difficult to start. It's like you create a new account, you have to do something called warming up an account, which is a little bit annoying, but then you can just start posting. We'll get to that influencers. This is pretty difficult to start you have to DM hundreds of influencers. You're lucky if one replies, then you're lucky you can negotiate a deal with them, get them to post. All of these things will get into and paper click ads also very difficult to start. I was actually in between with influencers and paper click, which is the most difficult to start. Because they both have their difficulties and parts that are easier about them. So I'd say they're pretty similar. However, the reason I say paper click is more difficult is because it's generally more saturated. And so maybe like first of all, it requires a ton of setup, but even once you get started, it's not just about getting started in order to run it successfully the right way, be profitable. That's going to be so much more difficult than influencers usually, at least right off the bat. And it's a lot more setup than anything else for sure. The consistency curve. So this is like, can you rely on this channel to basically pulling the same number of downloads on a week over week, month over month, day over day basis. So organic content, this is the most sporadic. So all about the algorithm. People usually will post like 10 videos and they'll apply the pre-do principle, two of those will go viral and justify either the cost or time spent on those other eight videos that did not go viral. So that's organic content. So like, you don't know when a video is going to go viral. It's like randomly, you'll have these spikes. And maybe they normalize over a long period of time influencers influencers are definitely more steady because you can predict and we're going to get into how to do this, how many views your video will get. And so you can align things where you're basically pulling the same number of views per day and assuming your content is a similar quality, you'll get around the same number of downloads per day. Paper click ads are the second most consistent where the algorithm is really the it will it is it is complex and we'll get into all the complexities. However, generally, once you have it all set up once you have your ad creatives the videos, the videos that you're running as ads all set up and you set up your ad budgets. The algorithm will spend that amount every single day and until you exhaust your creatives, you'll see the same performance and exhausting creatives is something I'll explain later. And then we have apps or optimization and this is just pretty steady, like not that many people will search your keywords, not that many people will search for your app, but it will be pretty consistent over, you know, over the week or month, time period. Attribution tradeoffs used to be a bigger deal. So I was thinking of making another one of these curves, but I decided not to because in the past, one of the big one of the big reasons to run paid ads over something like influencer marketing is because of the attribution you could figure out exactly where the downloads came from. You know exactly how many downloads came from one ad with influencers think about it. They just posted video and there's no links on a tick talk. So the person that sees the videos to go download your app from the app source separately. And you don't know where they came from. You know, they may have came from the video because they were posted at the video is posted around the same time the download was in, but you can't get much better attribution than that. Especially if you have multiple posts going out at the same time because you're operating at such a large scale. So paid ads were better for so long because you could have hundreds of different ads running and each one would track how many downloads came from it specifically down to down to the device ID. But now because of all of Apple's regulations, you can do that anymore. And so attribution is very tricky. Therefore, it's almost just as hard as attributing influencer marketing at this point. Cool.

So before we get into any specific channel, it is very important that you understand what goes viral on social media. So the key metrics are watch time, plus people sharing, plus engagement. Well, actually engagement is included in people sharing, but basically just getting someone to watch your video and then have an interaction. So whether that's sharing the video, commenting, hardening the video. That is what ultimately causes the algorithm to pick it up and show it to more people. And there are many ways to skin a cat and go viral. The hook is by far the most important. You need to have a scroll stopping moment. And there are many different ways to do this. You need to capture the attention. And these users, the average time a teenager is spending on their phone nowadays is fucking ridiculous. It's like seven hours a day that they're just sitting there scrolling TikTok. And so they see hundreds of not thousands of videos. What's to say they would stop on your video? Why are you so special? You need something that's going to fucking catch their attention and get them to stop. So there are a few examples that I've pulled. These are not the only ways to get someone's attention. But these are pretty common ones that you'll see. So one is a fight. Everyone loves watching a fight at school. What's the most, what's the biggest event that always happens where everyone just surrounds people in a cafeteria or pulls out their phone, starts recording, shares it to their friends. A fight. People are fighting and everyone wants to see. Fight. It's just human nature that people want to watch them. So. I don't know what they're fighting, but yeah, she's swung at her. And this video got 415,000 likes. And I don't know if we could pull this, but at least a few, yeah, 7.6 million views. Now this guy then goes in and just talks the rest of the video and talks about. I don't even know what he talks about. But this was the hook that got people to stop and watch. They even did. Oh my god. Oh my god. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. This is. And then the rest is like, okay, you got people to stop. Now him talking. That's like get the watch. I'm get people to watch. Get people to comment. Share. Like, let's read some of these comments. I mean, people are talking about the fight. Let's, let's, what does he even tell us? He's talking about the fight. And then you do something on the same topic to get the watch time, get people to share, get people to like and engage. Okay. The next scroll stopping moment that we're going to go over is another human desire, an urge a primal and neat thing is sex people are gonna stop if they see a hot girl let's see don't fucking die like this bro there's no fucking hack bro there is no boom catches your attention with a hot girl and the rest of the videos like you got a lot of fucking die like this bro it's not a hot girl anymore the hook got you to stop and then the rest like it's motivation it gets gets you to like the video gets you to comment maybe share it to a friend trick them and thinking it's a hot girl and it's motivation as well and so that is another good way to hook someone in and there are a lot of variations by the way of how to use any of these hooks like this sex hook a lot of times it's used for different motivation pages to be like to catch your attention and they're like you got to lock in man you're being too distracted but then there's also a lot of other people doing that like the quitter guys they have a whole channel dedicated to this Connor and Alex where they show a video of some hot girl and then it cuts to like the goon police is what they call it's actually see if we get pulled up right now goon police yeah this is their account so let's see what they're doing oh you have been doing police very nice so beautiful baby so they're just basically making fun of people that are that are doing it it's getting their attention and then drives them to quitter that's their hook their hook is sex the next scroll-solving moment is getting an influential figure now at a certain point for celebrities you no longer need a hook for for I guess influencers I'll say not celebrities because that doesn't necessarily imply that they're on social media but when people think of influencers they mostly think of tiktokers those kind of people so early on they need hooks to get people to stop and then watch to hear what they're whatever they're gonna say but then if you become famous enough you become the hook why does mr. Beast use his face on every single thumbnail every single thumbnail I was mr. Beast face because he is the hook he is the scroll-solving moment you see his face and you associate that with good content you know you're gonna get something good you know you're gonna get what you want it's the same thing with on tiktok you're scrolling you see someone famous you see a famous mr. Beast video you're going to stop and scroll so let's see how it's used one dollar or mr. a gift so that was passed the hook the hook by the way is always like the first three seconds and right away you could see mr. Beast boom mr. Beast right there it's very possible and mr. Beast isn't even talking he doesn't need to talk for people to know it's him and for him to be used as the hook he's just there and this video this guy alone he's pretty famous it's four million followers but notice how this was his most popular video ever one of them I see there's a 24 million view on but this video 22.8 million views and that's not a coincidence that's because it's a collab with mr. Beast mr. Beast whose way more famous is used as the hook whereas the other ones it's the same exact video but it's just without mr. Beast hooking them in there's also the curiosity hook let's watch this about the universe let me tell you a secret about the universe I want to know a secret about the universe what's this secret you could say adjutant at this point he kind of is the influential figure hook or like him alone seeing his face a lot of people numb and are drawn to him but he was doing this before he was famous this is actually part of how he got famous as he would say these bold things he would make these statements you would draw people in with curiosity and that's how obviously did a lot of controversial stuff too but you need the hooks everybody always says so whatever then he keeps talking gets watched on blah blah blah so okay then there is the urgency plus camera angle and this was actually I wanted to show this one because it was more relevant it was an app and it will watch this for a silent breakdown what they do well I'm gonna be waiting for work thank god I got this thing installed there's the fit let's get dressed oh thank god I'm gonna go know hat but it's fire let's go this guy wakes up in bed he it's a first person point of view is like shit I'm gonna be late for throws off the cover jumps out of bed the viewers strong on ticked out there like what is this who's this guy that's like jumping out of bed you don't even have time to react and think you see this guy that's just fuck coming to be late for work it's like a relatable thing it's urgent it's there's a lot of urgent see there for work the viewers hooked instant hook right there and then he goes into his out got I got this thing which shows I don't actually know that his that he's just coming to this but it shows how to choose your outfit well thank god three million likes tens of millions of views you need your scroll-sopping moment is to give you ideas of how to get people's attention the rest of the video does not matter as much I'd say the hook is 50 is at least 50% of the work going into a video after that you're just trying to get them to enjoy what they watch you want something relating to the hook otherwise there's swipe off after the hook ends you want to keep keep them interested and then ideally they'll share the video or like if if you can pull that off

Let's jump into how to do some influencer marketing before we start. Let's go through some case studies So this is my app on Blake's app Cal AI So get some of our videos 700 calories. It's that bright eggs and bacon 50 grams of protein 55 fat one of the cool things about the Cal AI with traveling I get a lot of people kind of knock it because it only like the whole take a picture of your food track your calories But if you want to track it exactly by weight has the same database my fitness pal But you can put in a description of what you're eating so like a lot of times They're not been going out of but like fruit bowl with like Greek yogurt and it will give me like a rough estimate But at least it still have somewhat of an idea what I'm eating while traveling since I can't weigh anything because of eating out of Every single meal there's multiple things you can do in the app. It's not just a calorie picture app You can use like actual databases. So this is one of our influencers Alex Ubank who's pretty famous very well known in the fitness community There's another video that got a million views What I eat and what I eat and the other pretty popular girl and kids are I think she was on That was a lot more of a seamless You Not even saying in Kalei or anything in the video. She's just showing us news and other awesome stuff. Oh, that's insane. Oh, and all that all we are calling out now to get never looking at. That's insane. Oh, what's in front of me. Oh, thanks. Oh, well, thanks, Patrick. Oh, notice people are commenting what app we're using. Cool. Let's go to another one. Andrew Maxer. 13 million views. Cool. Yo, three shows the problem. Should like, solution for problems. Okay. 13 million views right there. Another one. Oh, this is it. Is this quitter? That was quitter. We'll get to that one. But last Kalei, I video. I'm trying to show you guys different varieties of how we do influencer helping in Kalei. We have some cruders that talk to the camera about Kalei. Some cruders that show a day in their life of what they're doing, they just casually throw on Kalei. Some people are chefs. They make their food. And then they scan to see how many Kalei's their food is with Kalei. They have to show the whole recipe. And yeah, other people are asking like, okay, what app do you use? So big thing of the food strategy, but we'll get into all of the nuances. So that's like a few different types of videos from Kalei and our strategy. Quitter is very similar. Let's see some of their viral videos. 17 million views. By the way, I just want to say I didn't pull like our most viral videos. I think our most viral video to date probably is like 20, 30 million views. I'm not sure. But I just want to show what the what you can. What the average or typical videos we have usually are. Okay, let's go to Quitter. This is like kind of a cinematic video. Kind of like sad, sad, melancholy music. Beautifully shot. It really tells the story well. Now this person was going to watch porn, but then now they used Quitter. Notice how this isn't like this video. By the way, sponsored by Quitter guys are doing dropped. But if you're trying to quit porn download our app. I actually really recommend it guys. Thank you back to the video. No, it's not like that. That's what you might find on YouTube. For short form influencer marketing, you do not want to do that. That is not good. See this count. Pretty famous 1.4 million followers. Let's go through another. Jeremiah Jones also an influencer for Cal AI on this guy. Excuse me. I think it was so hot and you have an amazing body. What are you doing? Shoot in my shot. How about doing a movie? On me. What are you doing? 30 minutes. Be outside. We're going to go right? I don't know if that's time to get some footage. It does show Quitter. And that causes a lot of conversions. Okay. Let's go through another. This is actually this video specifically was massively viral for them. I got 10 million views. But it was I believe their most their highest converting video out of all videos. This video got brought them over 100,000 dollars in just two days. This video will 100,000 dollars from this video. Let's watch it. Notice it's like always the same screen that these apps are shot for Cal AI. It's taken picture of your food. For Quitter, it's the panic button. These are the features where someone is very visual. You see it. Wow. And I understand what this app does on the canteen right now. Let's look at it. What happens is that people are telling him. Okay. So we just went through two apps of hours. And I'm going to show that other apps are doing this too. It actually this used to be something that really only indeed. I just developers were doing is influencer marketing because it's a very untabbed space. The fact that you're learning about this, you have a massive advantage. No one knows how to do this. No one does. Except a few people like us. But some big companies are now starting to dip their toes in the water. Like Block Blast, for example. It is not a utility app like Cal AI or Quitter. It's a game. And I think they're one of the only games that are doing influencer marketing. And it's working amazing for them. So one million views. Let's see. Now Block Blast, we can party. You have a best friend. You're a last best friend. You have a gap. Stop it. Block Blast. You know, I'm always getting the high scores with her. She's just amazing. She's beautiful. And she always keeps me entertained. I've been through a lot these past few years. And Block Blast has always been there with me. Look at my high score. If that's not true friendship, I don't know what is. I can play Block Blast anywhere anytime. It's amazing. It's always there for me. So you're having a birthday party for an app. Yeah, don't say app like that. It's a long video. But essentially, it's clearly an influencer marketing video for Block Blast. Got a million views. A lot of people about to start playing this now 169 likes. A lot of people downloaded the app because of this video. And by the way, referencing one of the last units, let's just go through quickly. I want to say the hook. What's this hook here? It's the really urgency as a hook. She's setting something up. You don't know what she's setting up. You're curious and something urgent is happening. Cool. And she shows Block Blast. And there's one more video that will go through another Block Blast video. So these are all kinds of different videos that display how influencer marketing can be done. It all shows the scale. It could lead to $100,000 and 48 hours just from one single video being done right. And you can really scale this at Cali. We have like 30 videos going out every single day. And so we're sustainably getting a few million views a day, which lead to a bunch of downloads every single day and a bunch of revenue. I think yesterday we did around 100k, $100,000 in sales. And this is primarily from influencer marketing. So let's move on to the next section now that you can see the possibilities of what influencer marketing can do.

So I know I just showed a bunch of examples of influencer marketing, but what truly is it? Influencer marketing is basically when you have someone who already has a loyal following promote your product and ideally this is done in a very authentic way where the audience will actually believe that your the influencer you're working with uses the product actually likes the product is genuinely a supporter and therefore they're going to trust the influencer saying that it's good product and they will believe that your product is actually a good product. There's actually been a study done recently. Apparently people trust influencers more than doctors which is pretty insane. Maybe it's not all genes are users but it's a trend that's increasing a lot of people. I actually saw some other article that showed a even bigger number than this but more and more people are starting to trust influencers over any authority figure. So this is something that is only going to be getting bigger influencer marketing as a space and as a marketing channel. It's only going to get more powerful. You could think of it as a transfer of trust. The trust that the audience has in the influencer will be transferred to trusting your product. It's social proof. The influencer is saying it's a good app and their audience will believe them and then it's an emotional connection because if they really support the influencer if they feel like they know them this is kind of called a cult like following when the influencers a deep deep connection with their audience then when the influencer uses something their audience who wants to be exactly like the influencer will go get it and that's really how you have to look at this. A lot of these influencers will just get views and we'll get into that more but that's what you want to stay away from because views alone are worth nothing. You need views that are tied to an influencer which is tied to an audience that trusts them. The audience doesn't trust them if the audience doesn't support them if the audience doesn't like them they will not buy something that influencers themselves. They won't want to be like the influencer and they won't use something that influencer uses or supports. The bottom line is that people trust people. People do not trust companies. So having a person represent your brand and influencer represented and influencers support it that's what these audiences will trust. Cool. Let's move on.

The first step of influencer marketing is finding influencers who would have guessed. So I'm going to teach you guys how to do that. Before we start hunting down influencers that can promote our apps, it's very important to know what type of influencer you are looking for. The best way to do this is to look at the core demographic of your product and then figure out where they hang out online. For example, Kalei, a calorie tracking app. Who's our core demographic? People who work out, people who go to the gym. Where do people who go to the gym hang out? What influencers online do they watch? And when I say hang out, I mean hang out online. What content are they consuming every day? Fitness influencers, people that show how to do workouts, people that show their gym routines going into the gym. So we knew, okay, these are the influencers we want talking about Kalei, our product. You have to do the same thing reverse engineer this for your own app. It's harder for some apps than others. For Kalei, it's pretty straightforward, calorie tracking working out. There's our hand in hand. So workout influencers. For an app like Quitter, for example, which we showed some videos on, it's harder to find influencers. There are no, there are a few actually, but there are much fewer porn influencers like influencers that talk about porn prevention. Then there are influencers that talk about working out because it's a much more sensitive topic, much more to do. And so what Quitter did is they saw, okay, men between the ages of 13 to 18, more than 50% of them have a porn addiction. And so if we go after influencers that target that where their audience is this demographic is mostly made up of young men, then Quitter should be pretty applicable to most of the audience. And that actually worked out. We could see with Jeremiah Jones, that video that went super viral made them over 100K in just 48 hours. It's because his audience is mostly young men. And so that worked really well. You have to do the same thing for your app, figure out where your core audience is and then which influencers they watch. If it's some kind of food app, like a recipe app, then it's probably chef influencers that they're watching how to prepare different dishes. You have to figure it out. Once you have, and this might take experimentation, honestly, you might not get it right the first time. And once you start, you'll start very broad. But then you'll eventually, sorry, you'll start very niche down. You'll start as niche as possible to the core, to the most core demographic that you can. And then you usually expand. So with Cal AI, we started with the hardest core fitness influencers. And at this point, we're working with anyone. We're working with Piper Raquel, who's a girl that has a big audience of younger girls on her, mostly teenage girls. And she is, she promotes all kinds of things. It's mostly just relatable, funny content about being a girl. And so it was unclear in the beginning. Is this going to convert well for Cal AI? But it did convert well. And we hypothesize that is because most of our audience is young girls and teenage girls are often insecure about their bodies and therefore they want to count their calories. So Cal AI actually worked really well. This wasn't an obvious thing in the beginning, but now she's one of our most profitable influencers. So it may not be the influencers that work best for you may not be the most obvious and may take a bunch of experimentation. Once you find the influencer archetype you're targeting, we have to source them. There are many platforms and agencies that claim to do this. But for my experience, they all fucking suck. They all suck. And I just use TikTok and Instagram by their selves to find my influencers. I turn the 4U pages into lead generation engines. So let's see how we're going to do that. So the 4U page method, you want to create a fresh TikTok account and then it's basically just interacting with videos that are in your niche. So let's go to TikTok. If I'm trying to find finished influencers, I'll look up something like Men workouts. Man workouts gym. Okay, weird that no results are found. There definitely are videos to search algorithms for these platforms actually aren't always. Is there anything better that Jami Rossbury? What the fuck dude? Okay, I gotta put a marker to cut this. I do that. Okay, cut, cut right here. I don't what the fuck dude the girl showed in fact. What the fuck? So we're here on TikTok and now I'm going to look up Men workout. Boom. And here we'll get all kinds of different influencer men showing how to do workouts. What you'll want to do is just go through and like bookmark, comment, follow the influencers. I did it because this is just demonstration purposes. But this guy, let's see, 355,000 followers. And if you do this on another video, if you just scroll through and you start liking, commenting, engaging with a bunch of videos in your niche, you will eventually get your for you page to only be these early on when you first create a brand new TikTok account. TikTok won't know what you like. So it will just show you random content. So you want to start by searching for something so you could also search hashtag fitness. And here are a ton of more creative. So you'll want to go through like all of these videos, comment, whatever. Eventually it will turn into your for you page being all your niche and you want to keep going. You want to keep scrolling through liking videos, bookmarking. This is positive reinforcement to the algorithm that is showing you the right content. And at a certain point, you will only get content for of influencers in your niche that you want. It's a lead generation engine, whereas you just need to scroll and then everyone's everyone's an influencer. Some aren't good influencers that you want to work with because maybe they're too small, maybe the reviews aren't consistent, but they're all going to be in your niche and you can work with them. Okay. So that is really like the search method, the field. You could also, you can't do this on a computer. You have to do this on your phone on the app. So it's better to do it there. But you can, after you search, you could sort by like count. And the last three months posted in the last three months to make sure that the creators you're actually you're actually liking videos are are more relevant. So Instagram is basically the same thing. You could also just curate your for-you-page to be all influencers. But there is an additional feature on Instagram called the related accounts method. Basically, if you go on Instagram and you look up some fitness trader, so fitness creator I know is Jeremiah Jones. After you follow that creator, boom, I actually feel bad. I wasn't following him before. There is a drop. Okay, here it goes. There is the suggested for you. And this suggested for you is usually all also similar creators. So Sam Solok, huge fitness influencer. Boom, David Goggins, huge fitness influencer. William Scott, huge fitness influencer. Thomas Lee Fit, fitness influencer. And it just keeps going. So this is also another way to just find more influencers. So the first way is like, okay, you get your for-you-curate-your-for-you-page to just give you influencers. And then the second way is to look at this suggested for you. Find an account, boom, follow them. And then you get a bunch of suggested for you. You go down the rabbit hole and you keep getting all of these influencers. You keep hitting them in their DMs. But we're going to get into that in the next section. So that is generally the best way to find influencers. The next section we'll get into how to reach out to them.

Okay, here we go. Once you've found some influencers, you're gonna wanna reach out to them. So, first of all, in order to hit the influencers, make them see your message. We're gonna go through, we're gonna need, we're gonna craft a perfect message for you, but it's important to know how you're going to contact them in the first place. DMs are usually open with these influencers, and so that's the first place you wanna hit them. It is just send a message in their DMs. We'll go through that. And then also, you'll want to find their email. This is often going to be in their bio, but if not, you'll want to look it up on Google. So, like the more places you hit them, the better. Generally, we will train our team to only hit them on DMs and emails, but if you could find some hidden social media accounts of theirs that are old and maybe still active, if you could find their mom's account, if you could find all kinds of ways to get in contact with them, do that, do that, just do whatever it takes, getting in touch. But first of all, DMs, how do you make sure that they open your message? Well, it's a few things. One, make sure you're sending a message from a verified account. Early on, early on you'll want to send it from a verified account. Once your brand is popular, send it from your brand account. If you're sending DMs from a brand account with like 20 followers early on, you're like, hey, I'm looking for you to do a paid promo with my app, they're gonna be like, what the fuck? This is probably some scam I'm not doing it. So you'll have a much lower response rate. You won't have a zero response rate, but it will be much lower. What's better is to do it from your account. You know what, you should actually just do it from your brand account, but probably buy followers, buy likes, give yourself some social proof. That's the best. If you're not gonna do that, then do it from your personal account, make sure you pay for the verification. There are a lot of influencers who only open DMs from people that are verified. So that is important. In your message, you'll want to craft something like this. This is the exact message we use for Cali-I. We hit them right away, paid promo. This is what's shown in the preview of the message. The preview is going to be the first line of your DM. And so the influencer is gonna be scrolling through. It's gonna be a lot of, oh my gosh, I love your content. I wanna meet up with you, I want your number, can your kids be named after me about all these random things that people are sending the influencers, bunch of weirdos, but yours is gonna stick out. Paid promo, straight to the point, they click into it. Our calorie tracking app calculates the macros and calories of your meals by simply taking a picture. Let us know if you're interested in working with us and we'll send over more details. Happy to provide references of other creators. We work with if you'd like. We say who it's from in the Cali-I team. Simple, snappy, straight to the point. It tells you exactly what our app does, tells them the next step if they're interested and some social proof. We'll tell them, yeah, we've worked with other creators. We'll give you references. What could be even better than this is to say who the references are. So if you have a big influencer, you worked with sliding that in there. And then add a human aspect to it who it is. Boom, this is great for DM. So you'll want to do something very similar for your app. Generally, it's like, okay, keep the paid promo. Our blank app does blank. Let us know if you're interested in working with us and we can send over more details. The happy to provide references. If you have no other creators, I mean, you could just put that there. Most creators don't actually ask for references. So you're probably fine. You're probably fine, but you might want to change that line to like, yeah, honestly, I would just keep it in there. I think it's all good. I don't think anyone really asks us. Maybe one out of 10 influencers will ask that. And yeah, if they reply, I would just hold off from replying to them until you do or with another influencer. So, okay, this works great for DMs. For emails, you'll want something a little bit longer, but you'll want the same thing. I would short snap these straight to the point. So the subject line, that is extremely important for emails and you'll want basically the same thing, paid promo in the subject. For us, we do paid promo with Cal AI. That's the subject line. And then it's like this, but a little bit longer just because emails people are used to a little bit longer messages. It's maybe adding in like, hi, we love your content and think it would be a great fit for our app period. And then it just goes into this exact same thing. So, okay, you don't want to necessarily just send this to anyone. You really only want to work with at least early on and really anytime you're working with influencers, you want to see at least 50k views on TikToks or Instagram Reels on average. That's very important. If they're getting views that are all over the place where sometimes a few hundred views, sometimes a few thousand views, and then sometimes a few million views, because there are accounts that do that where it's like a thousand, thousand, thousand million, thousand, thousand, five thousand million. And you don't want an account like that. You want an account where it's very consistent. Because if it's consistent, you can easily predict how many views your video will get in advance. And if you can predict in advance how many views your video is going to get, that means that you can figure out a price that will be profitable for you. This is how, this is where most brands go wrong. Is that they think influencer marketing can't be profitable. It can be. You just have to look for specific accounts and then refine your formula for how much you're offering to them. And that's something we'll get into in the next section. Connor will actually take over from there and talk about the negotiations. But okay, let's keep going with this. You definitely want to see a consistent posting schedule. And by the way, not all of these, do you need to be always checking before sending the DM. It's a lot easier just to spam off DMs and then after they reply, assess if they qualify or not. So yeah. So that is what I would do. A huge one is the comment section. As we discussed before, views by themselves are meaningless. You need views that are attached to an audience that loves the influencer, that wants to be the influencer. And you could tell this through the comment section. If they're writing out well thought out paragraphs, like, hey, man, you really inspired me to get up and get going today. You got me to get out of the gym, whatever it is. That is a real community. That's someone who has a deep connection with the influencer. That's an influencer you want to work with. Especially when you see people replying to other people, if someone writes a paragraph and then someone replies to that paragraph with another paragraph, this is just beautiful sign. You want to see a lot of likes on every comment. That means the community is interacting with one another, being supportive of one another. If you see this, these are great signs that the influencer will be high at converting. If they use your product, their audience will too. Here's some red flags and consistent views. Comments full of emojis. Comments are full of emojis, like fire emojis, hard emojis. It's usually like bot views. They may not actually be real bots, but it's just low quality traffic and it will not have a high conversion rate of view to download. One word replies also bad and scattered posting schedules. If there's like a post, if it's very random, then it's often because the creator is deleting the posts that didn't do well. You only want to work with creators that you know their video is going to get a consistent amount of views, get the same amount of views as they typically do because otherwise you're just gambling. At that point, if you don't know, or at least have an estimate, how many views your video will get with the creator, then you're just gambling on it if it's going to blow up or not. And we don't gamble here. We run real businesses. Remember, followers don't matter. Only views and engagement do. Okay, so with this being said, we're going to move on to how to actually negotiate with an influencer and Connor will take it from here. Last thing that's super important for outreach is setting expectations straight. You are not going to get a reply to your first DM. You will probably not get a reply to your first 50 DMs. In fact, it's probably going to take you sending hundreds to get one reply. This is in DMs, by the way. And it is a snowball effect. Once you get one DM, once influencers see you start using, so once influencers see other influencers start promoting your app, it gives you some brand authority, some social proof. And so if they see your brand DMing them, they're more likely to open the message. They're more likely to respond. But it really is a numbers game. Email, you'll get a slightly higher response rate. There's a tradeoff I'm about to say. For email, it's like one in 10 emails, the creator will reply to, at least, like early on probably less, early on one in 21 and 30, but it will eventually get to one in 10 once you have enough brand authority. But in terms of DMs, that's like one in a couple hundred, if you're lucky early on. And it is important to keep in mind these two things. One, DMs are very good for getting in touch directly with the creator. If you're DMing them, it's likely that they don't have a manager on the account. And therefore, you're more likely to get better rates, better promo rates, better prices. Whereas if you email them, usually the influencers that have emails and their bios, they're trying to get brand deals, meaning that they potentially have a manager. Most of the time they do, if you reach out through an email that's in their bio. And these managers take a cut. So, nature, and they're also negotiating on behalf of the influencer. So, naturally, the prices are going to rise. Another important thing to mention is that, and this is something that Connor's going to go more into in the next section with negotiations, but minimum view guarantees, which is something he's going to define. Managers are a lot less likely to accept a minimum view guarantee. So, if you're working directly with the influencer, usually better, but a lot harder to get in touch. Messing through email, you'll get a higher response rate, but usually worse prices. I'd recommend you do both. Yeah, I would have love it.

Alrighty, let's get after it. What up boys? We are going to go over negotiations. So step one. Alright, you listening? Watch. Go. Be. A. Ready? Push it. Alright. Don't be a bitch. Okay? This isn't that hard. Have some confidence and let's get after it. So, what we are going to do is go over how to go from your DMs. Now you are doing outreach, right? You got responses from influencers. How do you take those influencer responses in your outreach, taking the DMs, responding to the DMs, alright, rhythm up, then take them to do some pre-call research, right? Get some information and then eventually get some call and close them to start posting content for you in raking and cash. Alright, here's the deal. Never share upfront pricing. If you are sharing upfront pricing, you are basically shooting yourself on the foot and asking yourself not to close an influencer. Alright, they are all going to say like what do you pay for a post, what do you do with this, how much are you willing to pay me? Alright, they all have egos, alright? Feed into them, but don't tell them the exact price. What you want to do is tell them we pay retainers ranging from $500 all the way up to thousands, 10,000 plus depending on the deal. And now then they are minding like holy shit. Bro, I can get paid $10,000 for this. Oh my god, now are we going to do that? Fuck no. Alright, now unless we are getting this like 6, 7 million views, we are doing that shit. But, the point here is to move the conversation to a call where you can tailor the deal. Now with your outreach messages, a lot of the time you are just going to send either number, you hop on a call with them, you want to send them the text, etc. But, if they start ripping back to you, hey what's the post, what can we do here, how much are you going to pay me? Always hit them with a, we'll pay you a couple hundred bucks up to a couple thousand depending on the deal structure. We have many deals. I would say generally if you are starting off, we are paying influencers anywhere from $500 to $500,000 depending on the deal. They don't have to know you haven't closed any influencers, but that's what you are willing to pay. So, that's honest. Alright, you are good. So, step 2 in this whole process is to get them on a call. Send them your number, tell them to call you, or get their number, send them a text right away, or call them right away, or book a call with them via text message. Right when you get their phone number, text them if you wait time, you're basically asking yourself not to close them. Step 2, you want to do some research. So, before this call, say you send them a text, you plan for a call tomorrow at noon, alright. And you need to figure out, what the fuck am I going to pitch, right? I don't know how much money I'm going to send them, I don't know what I'm going to pitch, how I'm going to use per video, what the fuck is a view guarantee that I hear Zach and Connor talking about, etc. But, here's what you're going to look for. You want to make sure they're posting daily, alright. No scatter gaps. You don't want any evidence to show you that they deleted under performing posts, and therefore you can find out, okay, if they're posting daily, they can post my videos once a week without bombarding their audience with sponsored content. They want consistent views, and you want consistent views, right. If they're pages performing, you care about their views, over their followers, only if there's a fuck about followers anymore, people care about attention. So, consistent views. We're talking at least 100,000 views per video. If you don't do that, then it's not really worth paying them, like 500 bucks a month. A lot of these guys won't do it unless they're just starting off. And so, you really want to look for at least 100,000 views per video. You can lower it based on what we're going to teach you in the pitch structure in this module. However, it might be hard for larger influencers that get more views to bite on that. And then you want to make sure there's engagement. So, we're going to go through two examples. One very good example, one shitty example. A great example is Jeremiah. Jeremiah kills it for us in Cali-I. As you can see, he gets roughly 200,000 views, 50,000, 120, 153, 358. It's Cali-I, video got 362. This is a quitter video got 473. So, Jeremiah rips fucking views. And the best part about it is he's posting daily, if not once or twice a day, five days ago, five days ago, six days ago, six days ago, right? Six days ago, seven days ago. So, he's posting multiple times per day. So, therefore, he can post our content, pushing our product without pissing off his audience. Now, another thing is, dude, his comment sections are fucking crazy. He has people commenting. He's literally having people react to him. People are like, holy shit, this is funny, this is not funny, et cetera. You want controversy in the comments. People do the greed, disagree. What you don't want is fucking fire emojis, right? So, if I'm going to show you another example, let's go to Dave. Not to shit on Dave here, but look at Dave. He's got great engagement, right? However, he doesn't really grip views, dude. What am I going to pay this guy? What up, V? On a join this, boy? We're shitting on Dave's content. See, only it's 30,000 views per video. Fuck this dude. I know, dude, he's chopped. But, like, guys, look, he doesn't get enough views per video. Therefore, we can't pay him a grand or even two grand. Dude, there are so many motherfuckers like this where it's like, how many followers? Yeah, but they have a lot of followers, especially guys that used to be relevant. Yo, if you're launching a product and you're thinking, who are the influencers that I should work with? Oh, here are the guys that I saw in the past. And then you go hit them up. They're going to tell you the $5,000 in a fucking dollar is for a post. And you're going to be like, man, influencer marketing doesn't work. It's like, no, you're going after the wrong people. Here's another example. You got this guy, Dewey, right? We used to work with him with Quitter. But what we did is we made a mistake. His fucking content gets laughing emojis. He doesn't have a community. No one gives a fuck about him. You, they laugh at him and it converted some, but at the end of the day, we don't want to work with him anymore so we clipped him. Dude, you want to see conversations occurring in the comments section and people referencing a past shit that the creator has done. One of the best examples of this is Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz is actually mad at me right now. I think I mentioned this very much during one of my videos. Because he thought I was talking shit because I was like supporting Sam and whatnot. And he and Sam are beefing. Drama. Yeah, a little bit of a pussy, but that's okay. Member guys. Don't be a pussy. But if you look at Santa Cruz's content, more so on TikTok, to be honest, actually maybe his Instagram following isn't as tight as I thought. But at the very least, it's all very real responses. It's like, it's all people leaving actual comments. You're not just seeing emojis. And I think that the mobile version is better at filtering for top comments and whatnot. Now, once again, point here being, you want creators that actually have people that care about them. For the content that they post. Rather than people that, and for who they are as a person, rather than creators that only have people that find the content funny and drop a laugh emoji and then move on. And this works because that creator actually has trust with their audience. And so therefore when they push your product, they're more likely to convert. 20 years by 10 minutes. All right. So now let me go through call research. We see that they have posting daily. They get consistent views per video and they get engagement. The next thing you have to do is free your pitch. So when you're looking at their content, we want to offer four videos per month of the video per week. And this can probably be cross post feed TikTok and Instagram. Some creators get a lot of views on Instagram, low views on TikTok or flip flop. And so what you do is you look at both of their accounts. You might find, okay, Jeremiah can get me a quarter million views on Instagram. And like 50,000 views on TikTok. Therefore I'm like, all right, it's 300,000 views. That's 1.2 million views a month. So I can be like, okay, at a $2 CPM is what you really want the rate. If you need low end $2, high end $3, maybe you can go a little lower than $2 that higher end deals with like five to 10 K a month. However, generally speaking for you guys need, it's going to be a $2 CPM high end 3, or else you're going to be eating in your margins, probably losing money. So if you look at Jeremiah, right, he has... Right, roughly quarter million views. So I would go to him, I'll offer you $2,500 for 1.2 million views. Right? He'd be like, oh, this is sick. He'll probably bite on that because we can offer him a retainer and we're pitching a long term deal here. We're not pitching him, hey, I want to do one post or I want to do one month. We're pitching him like, hey, we want to work with our creators six months, 12 months, 18 months, et cetera. Now, contracts for you over the next section are going to be structured in a way where you protect yourself and you clip that thing month one. Number two, another way to protect yourself is you'll pay a certain percentage up front. So usually pay up to 20 to 40% depending on the creator and what they want up front. So therefore you're protecting yourself on the downside. So if they only post three videos, you get an ROI and that 20% paid up front. And if they don't post, they don't hit their beauty guarantee. You don't pay them the rest of the videos. And that's very clearly outlined in the contract. And so the next thing is now you've got this structure. You know many views are getting, you don't need to usually want from them per month. You know me videos, they're posting. Okay. Now you're like, all right, I got to approach this call. How the fuck am I going to close them? I've never done a sales call. I don't know what's the fucking word. Skill set and sales will call it. But guys, this isn't very hard. All you have to do is be charismatic and approachable. Build rapport with them. Build trust. Like act like they're your boy. Just let me fucking talk to them. People want to be treated like humans. And so the intro of the call, I highly recommend getting to know the person. Talk into them. Don't just dive into the deal because I'm just going to feel like you're there just to suck value out of them. Which we are, but you want to build a relationship. We've relationship with all of our creators. Like we can text them. Like a text fucking Jeremiah right now or call me to respond. Now the second thing is concern. Confirm that it's a fit. Make sure that they're comfortable posting your content. You've already looked at their contents and you know it'll fit with your product. So you kind of know this, but you're basically having them tell you it fits. They're confirming for you like, hey, yeah, this works really well with my audience. They love this. This isn't feel salesy like piss of pitching like fucking sell seats or some large company. And no one gives a shit about anymore. It's another more comfortable. Then you present the offer like, look, hey Jeremiah, I want four videos a month. That's one video a week. The view guarantee is based off your consistent view. So this is something that you can hit and achieve. And we're not trying to fuck you on this. Now with the CPM baseline, I would highly recommend not saying we're basing this off on this. CPM, which stands for cost per million, cost per thousand views. You just say, hey, I'm going to pay $2,000 per million views. That's simple. You can say, I like that. I don't like that. He doesn't like that. And you should be like, hey man, like what do you want? Right? What are you thinking? What makes this worth your time? And then he'll give you a number. The biggest a joke objection you'll get is the view guarantee. Right? So it would be like, I don't want to do a view guarantee because I don't want to hit the views. And you simply say, look, we base this off of your content. You post two times a day, you get these views. So you're going to hit this. And it's your job to get views, our job to convert those views. Right? So we can't make a, we can't cover our bottom line costs and anything, let's be get paid through conversions, which the influence or brings. And so now they're more comfortable because they're like, oh shit, like I'm going to get them views and then I'm going to get paid for getting views. Instead of just being a one off deal from fucking dick sporting goods for 5K, they get like once a year. Now, now this has been said, they're comfortable. You close them basically. They're ready. They're like, I'm in Connor, right? Let's go. Hands down. What you want to do is in schedule follow up. So generally, I schedule follow up, review the contract. I follow the text saying, like here's what we spoke about, just confirming. I will send the contract, please send me your email. And so generally, they call, like as long as you set expectations, confirm they're a fit and they tell you they're a fit. They understand that they're posting four videos a month once a week. Maybe you can pick a day that they post and you follow up. They understand the retainer deal structure and they're line up pricing. You're done. It's closed. Done deal. Game over. All right. If they're not ready, whether it's because it's too high of a budget, you don't have the money for them, etc. I would honestly just stay in touch with them. Follow up with them every couple of weeks. We're having to think about it. Schedule call. If I can't not ready, you need to figure some things out. Let's schedule call on two, three days. Let's put it on the calendar and we'll talk then. What I said about the view guarantee, I usually pitch this. As I said, you say for a million views a month, we'll pay $2,000. I wouldn't say to $2 a CPM. You don't need to use a link that could confuse them. And then you just tell them, look, we're paying you for getting views and we're going to convert those views for a long term partnership. It's very fruitful for both of us. As I noted, their jobs give you, your job is convert those views. You can be very polite when you say that. You're really just pitching that to mutual benefit. When it comes to objections and responses, usually they say like, hey, I usually say, I usually get paid five grand per per post, Blake was saying. These guys have been the issue for a while. You see a paid fucking so much money for doing nothing. These fucking companies are retarded. Now the game is you want views. I can pay you five knowledge per post. That's two grand. I need a million views. I can get you quarter million views. That's worth $500 to $750. It's not a good fit. You move on. You're doing so much outreach. You're going to have tens of 20, 30, 40 creators responding every single day as you send 100 DMs a day. So generally, just work backwards, work with them, be understanding. When it comes to the view guarantee, I would just basically say, hey, your job is to get views consistently. Our job is to pay you. And this view guarantee is based off what you already average or views wise. So it's achievable. We're not asking for you an unrealistic ask and try to fuck you. And if they don't hit the view guarantee, you structure your contracts to basically say they're going to keep posting to hit it or you pro rated. So for example, if they get 800,000 views and they need a million, they can just post again to hit that. And then you pay them after they post that fifth video or say they get half million views and just get a million. You can be like, all right, I'll pay you a grand and set a two grand, right? 50% of the contract. So once the rate of proceed, I recommend sending the contract same day. Get them to look at it, follow up with them, make sure they're comfortable. Get that shit signed and onboard them. Usually the onboarding, I usually set up a group chat with my team. They handle that and we're in the communications. Make sure everything goes smoothly. Or when we're starting out, I would just text them, get the contract signed, ready to go. And next is management them. So at the end of the day, like we mentioned, if they're not ready, just be understanding. Schedule a second call. If they're out of budget, just tell them, hey, we'd love to reach back out when our budget grows. To be super respectful, you don't want to burn any bridges in this industry. We did that and it kind of fucked us. We had to repair relationships because I was like, oh, no, screw you this and that. You kind of get your emotions. You drop the fucking ego and plane to their ego. Make it seem like they're getting the better end of the deal here. So once you've finished this, put them in your CRM. I recommend just setting up a Google Sheet with Info and her name, followers, links to TikTok, etc. The deal structure, right? How many videos are getting? What you're paying them? The upfront payment? Log when you pay your first payment, your second payment. So they can track things. And then eventually, once you get over five influence, recommend using a tool like Groey, which will go over, which automatically tracks views, pays out. They handle all the documentation so you can actually write off these expenses for your business. Just the fucking cap this off. Look, be charismatic and understand. You can be confident without being a fucking dick. Don't be a fucking loser. Be soft. Get pushed around like, dude, understand this is a mutual benefit. You are helping them as well. Make sure they understand. And then you pitch it as they get the better end of the half. You're getting views. You can even set up bonus structures, which they may ask for. They may not. I don't recommend doing that off the bat unless they actually ask. And I wouldn't hard sell them because if you hard sell them, it becomes this pissing contest. And it's probably not going to lead to a deal. So at the end of the day, be charismatic. Do never talk about fucking pricing the DMs. Get them on a call, talk to them. You can go from there, like, yeah, just be human. So that is how you negotiate with influencers. Next we're going to talk about managing them, how to track them. And yeah, it's fucking get after it, boys.

To cap off influencers, you guys gotta understand that influencers are not just individuals. They're also pages. An influencer is really anyone that you can have a paid placement opportunity with a massive amount of reach. So when it comes to these pages, you have usually a core for them. You got motivational pages, meme pages, news pages, and college student pages. Now if we're going to go through these, this is a meme page, fuck boy problems. Quitter, for Quitter, we've run a ton of memes on here. They just pump out memes and things get everywhere from a couple of hundred thousand views to millions of views. Due to their existing, I want to say brand reputation in the space. And also everyone loves them. Like, do people know who they are? Another one is motivational pages. You have bolt motivation here, which rips hundreds of thousands of views about popular and influential people, along with movies, etc. And he makes it engaging, like appears a good karate kid. It's about to face the whole way this little hell. It's got one chance to get it. You could easily approach this company and this page and be like, hey, we have a motivational aspect in our app. We'd love to partner. Another one is college accounts. So college fencing is one. Five million followers, they rip views, and all it is is memes about college. And now it's school starting right now. It's currently end of August. Dude, it's just going to rip. And if you have an app in this space, starting college kids, highly recommended targeting one of these theme pages. Now, why do theme pages work? Same as influencers. They have masses reach. They have brand familiar reputation. And you can also get direct conversions. On top of that, you can increase your brand awareness. If you have influencers posting about your product, and on top of that, now you have a pop-your-themed page posting about your product. Bought a Bing-Bought-A-BOOM. They're going to hit five to ten times in the algorithm about your app, your software. Now they're going to download, and they're going to convert. They're going to be like, oh, shit, we have this theme page talking about it. And my three favorite influencers talking about it. Like, this must be legit. Like, I got this. The downloaded product, your product works. They get the value out of it. Bought a Bing-Bought-A-BOOM. Start telling their friends. Growth is exponential, guys. Now, when it comes to working with them, I would not overthink it. All you have to do is identify the pages, right? Just like you would any influencer. I would follow that same format. You can go to the theme page, right? And click the affiliated badge, and you can find more people like them. Like fucking shower feelings, right? Two million followers. And there's RIP. Once you have identified your pages, I would definitely message them. DM them like you would an influencer. And then same thing. Do not talk about pricing in the DMs. I highly recommend getting them on the call, and pitching a View Guarantee. Right? How we talk about it right here. View Guarantee models RIP. You can get a $2.00 CPM, get a million Guarantee views, and do $2,000 deal. So, at the end of the day, in order for you to execute on this properly, I highly recommend having your posts blend into their page, make sure you're leveraging humor, and double down the winners. If a post pops off, I'd reach out to other pages in that niche, whether it's college pages, meme pages, motivational pages, or news pages. And have them post that same structure, and you'll just compound the views, and it'll fucking rip. So, that is the impages for you. They're great for supporting influencer campaigns and top of funnel awareness. And at the end of the day, you will get direct conversions, but I would not bank on the fact that you're always going to get direct conversions. Yes, you can lose money with these pages. Yes, they won't always work, but highly recommended as a supplemental distribution method.

All right, Posys. You guys close your first influencer, what's next? Well, all you have to do is manage and track them to make sure that they're posting consistently and their content needs your requirements. So you've added them to your CRM, you're in a group chat with them, what's next? Pretty simple, the contract, right? We put that in the materials below. All you have to do is set up the contract, their name, their address, their contract size, which is their deal. So whether that's two grand for a million views, when they be paid out and the posting schedule, how you recommend them throwing all that in the contract. So there's no miscommunication on when things be posted, when they're paid, and anything that could eventually hurt you in the long run. But I wouldn't overthink this, there's a template, it's really simple, put that in the materials below. Next, they sound the contract, all you have to do is pay them, right? So if you're on a smaller scale, you have less than five influencers, highly recommend using PayPal or Venmo, if you're sending roughly just a couple thousand dollars a month. If you are sending more than a couple thousand dollars a month, you're handling five plus your 10, 15, 20 influencers, highly recommend using platform like Groey, which will have a whole section to showing you how to set up Groey, use Groey for performance tracking, to payment, to campaigns, etc. And the fourth thing is performance tracking. For now, if you're on the smaller scale, less than five influencers, I would just put it on Google Sheets, right? Set it up, influencer name, accounts, average views, what they're aiming to get, and when they're going to post, and then just put the link in there, and you can sum it up at the end of the month. When it comes to the schedule, and this is generally put in the contract, you say one video per week for four weeks. I don't recommend saying like every Monday because a lot of the times things get delayed, and they might not feel comfortable with that. So I generally in the onboarding call, make sure it's like hay or planning for Mondays, but you have a two day grace period. And it's your job to follow up on that Friday, Saturday, Sunday, how in the for that video, make the video reach requirements. When it comes to content requirements, the app needs to show the show in the first 15 to 20 seconds, and the content needs to be native to their audience. You can't be posting a video that makes no sense, right? The video has to be something that they normally post with it to day in the life, right? Think Kalei, whether it's Quitter or it's showing like how to become a dog and self development, and quitting porn is one of those things. And the last thing, which I think is the most important thing, is your aha moment, alright? This needs to be a clear engaging moment, which is a feature of your app, alright? A scroll stopping moment. Now think Kalei, that is scanning food. Whenever someone's watching a video a day in the life of fitness influence, with like holy shit, I can use AI to scan my food and get these calories done in seconds, and don't waste five to ten minutes, and log my fucking calories like a loser. For Quitter, it's the panic button, right? We say, look, if you have urges, which a lot of young men have, click the panic button, it walks you through it, it makes you actually look like an idiot if you guys have ever seen it. Another thing, community feature for us, alright? On Quitter, a lot of the fitness influencers and religious creators we work with always say like, you're three ways you can quit lust, three ways to change your life, a big one's sprouting yourself through community, and so they push the community feature on the app. Think about your app and what features can integrate in their content. That is going to make you win this game. Now, tracking on a more specific note, like I said, less than five creators, use a Google sheet, right? You don't need to overcomplicate this. Five plus use growing, automatically the key tracks, views, manage campaigns, you can schedule payouts, you can basically scale up without worrying about when to pay someone, how many views they get, and worrying about us also contracts, growing hands contracts. Now, when it comes to your workflow, I would say if you plan for Monday, makes you follow up on Saturday or Sunday to confirm the content is prepared, if they send it to you, you review it, it's good, you validate it, they can post it. Make sure it needs to guidelines. A lot of these influencers, much stack multiple deals in cut corners, you can't let them cut corners, that's why they're a contract. It's also why I highly recommend paying 20% on front. Now, there is a world where you're in a very competitive industry like Cal AI, for example, where everyone's trying to get the fitness influencers, alright? So they pay up front because they can't afford to lose an influencer. At the end of the month, right? So you have week one, they post, week two, they post, week three, they post, week four, they post. I highly recommend waiting a full week after their fourth post to total the views, make sure the view guaranteed was hit, release this final payment, and discuss the adjustments the next month, what if they don't hit the agreed view guarantee, what if they blow it out of the water, like I want to up this, up it, right? The whole point of this is to make sure that you are getting accurate data, which is fair for the influencer and fair for yourself. Boom, I got it.

GMGM. Alright, let's get after it. Grab your stimulants, grab your fucking coffee, grab your red bowl, your zins, your Lucy's, your SIGs, whatever it holds your boat, notes, fucking notepad and a pen, and let's get the fuck after it. Alright, here's the deal. We're going to be going over organic content. So the two main types of organic content are faceless and UGC. Faceless think of anything that you can rip and run with an editor, and UGC think of anything that is using an actual human to film themselves, film a hook, and then demo the app of some sort, maybe film a skit. So, diving into this, we will go through Riz, Riz GPT, if you guys know, Mr. Blake Anderson. They basically perfected, I would say, this format of, I'm positive or quickly, they basically perfected this format of Minecraft Park Core slash Dope of Mean hitting videos in the background with a text chat to show a guy having Riz. And so, let's watch this. Okay, you guys get the point. Another one would be, here we go. So keep in mind, this has almost 350,000 likes, it has a direct plug in the caption of the video. And with that said, another one that they do is the AI Bible chat. So, this is where you can see these rip a range of views from like almost 250,000 views, 230,000 views, but it's stories about the Bible. Using AI, obviously, which is something that I highly recommend a lot of you guys get into and learn is how can you leverage AI to your advantage in this game? Another one is for Quitter. This one's pretty funny. We have this account called the Goom Police because we realize that all of these only fan models are just ripping views, just being trashy online as the word I guess we'll use. And so, we have this Goom Police model. So, the whole point with this account is we built a our own basically theme page, right? From Info to the other theme pages around our own faceless format. And so we combine the two and create the Goom Police for Quitter. And we grew this like 10,000 followers in like less than two three weeks. So, that's another way you can do it. Full transparency. Like I said, we just have editors that we thought of this idea and told them what to do. They start cooking it up and we just mass-post. Another one is styles like this, which we posted on our actual Quitter account. No audio, funny enough. And it's simply just rage bait. Right? So, like this literally rage baits, comments like no other because it's literally saying everyone's a gooner except August and July. So, and gooning is obviously a hot topic. We want to talk about it. There you go. Another one is UGC. So, UGC like I said, is just own filming. So, just a pretense. This is for the App Haven, which is a Bible app. And this is what you did. It's a two-minute video. I don't think we need to watch this together. So, here. So, I don't obviously recommend doing it. Obviously, a minute 30 in, but I'm assuming that she also, yeah, I'm retarded. See, she's an influencer. That's on me. But the point is, is that you can rip and run styles like that for organic. Here's another one. So, this one is crazy case study. So, raise our boy sub, launch this, ripped it. I just got taken off the App Store, but they did very well with organic. And so, what they did is they had these girls filmed these before and after pictures. They filmed themselves with hooks, for example, like how to get 10 if you never get 10, showed the app. And this, I think video got millions of views. Yeah, 4.5 million. Another one is here. So, this is a turbo-learn organic content creator. So, turbo-learn is obviously an edtech platform to help you to, I know it's really study. This got 2.5 million likes. This account is organic. So, you'll see a lot of times, a lot of software's and apps will have one creator, usually like a college student or someone recently graduated looking to make money outside of school. Just rip styles. So, this girl is actually ripping styles. Like that style we just watched. She ripped that, what, 10, 15 more times. But, she only went viral on that one video we saw, which was where it was at 10.4 million views. And all the other ones got low views, except this one got 250,000 views. That's usually the game here. You want multiple creators posting multiple times to hit the algorithm and go viral. Last one is, so this is a skit style you'll see. And so, what this does is put the user in the famer reference that they're a student and they just got like in trouble from school. Now, you guys should know these are all staged, but the viewer on TikTok who watches does not know that. So, this was on one of their accounts last year, but that is, I would say, faceless and UGC in a nutshell. You should have a really good idea of what is faceless content, what is UGC? In faceless, you could also see things like carousel posts, UGC could also see different content. Some people do post like founder-led content, but when it comes to content like that, we are not going to dive into that because we think the highest levels that you can do are leveraging faceless and leveraging UGC to take over the algorithm, take over social media and push your app to the masses.

Alright, now that you guys have a good understanding of some of the examples of organic content, let's dive into these types. The first thing that all of you guys should fucking write down is that all content, especially organic content, need to invoke an emotion. What's gonna make them stop scrolling and watch your video? Is it the dopamine hit? Is it because it pisses them off? Rage bait? Does it draw a FOMO? Do they want to be a part of this movement? What is it? So that's first things first. Next, we'll dive into faceless specifically. So faceless, as I mentioned before, doesn't really feature a human behind the camera, like actually filming the video. But it does feature edits, trending audios, trending styles, maybe viral hooks, viral formats. And so if you think about this in the lens of how do I grab attention? We can go through and go back, go back through the content we went through before. For example, this video for Riz, right? This video goes through a text. So you're watching this. There's so many videos that are being bought in the market. So fucking annoying. But it has so many clips in the background of cutting food, like that fucking satisfying videos. And then it has like who the fuck is love maker, right? You already think to yourself, who's love maker? Then you're like, where is this going? Because a lot of people don't even go to the comments and be like, oh, they're plugging Riz app, right? But then it keeps going. They keep watching. Like, oh my god, where's this gonna go? I can't see the next text. I can't see the next text. Next thing you know, they get fucking plugged by Riz, right? Fucking here. Oh, might have missed it. But we went through it earlier. I think it's right here. Oh, it's over here. I got you. Got you guys right there. All right, Riz gets plugged because they were engaged like what's gonna happen next. This one would be Goom Police, right? We took clips of these fucking only thing girls, post themselves online and rage-baited guys. Right? We have so many comments of guys being pissed off at us and mad at us. We have DMs from some of these girls being like, you can't use this, but it made free rights because we edited it. We're not just ripping their content. And then they understand what quitter is. They're like, what the fuck is quitter? What is Goom Police? They click on the link. And next thing you know, they are landing page to Quigooning. And so now they're aware of it. They might not have converted, right? But they'll be aware of us when they see an influencer post or a Gena content or ads, they're more likely to convert down the line. Now what else is faceless? You've got hooks. This is organic actually. This is faceless. We'll get back to organic. So another one, Minecraft Parkour. All these videos plug Riz and show text every single day in DMs. Are you alright? It's been something. And so it's literally what it's doing and plug is Riz. And it makes it like, honestly, this feeds into what people want because people want drama and controversy and be like, what's happening? What's happening? What's happening? And then it shows that Riz is the reason that's saving the day. Riz app is the hero of that story. And I think faceless, like, does some faceless rip into I have some buddies and friends and people in the industry that we know that like make hundreds of thousand dollars on faceless. Yes. Right? It may work for your app. It may not. We highly recommend literally trying every single distribution strategy here. Test them thoroughly and find the one that works for you. We didn't do faceless like Quitter until probably like month four to month five in Fones is what started. Riz started with faceless. They ripped this format and ripped views and went super viral and they just kept doing it and changing iterating. So I recommend looking up trending formats and styles. Look up the Riz app. There's a tool, I'll give you guys at the end of this, called the social growth engineers, but they do case studies on these apps. Get into the Twitter bubble. See what people are doing and talking about. You can really become privy to what's happening, what's going viral on the internet and then apply it for your app. But yeah, faceless, recommend you can use CapCut, you can edit, you can hire editors, but generally speaking, it's carousels. There are people who can hire for this, which we'll go over later on. But generally speaking, it's a rip and run strategy. Okay, UGC. Now, UGC is content made by creators. Just for your guys to say, if you're going to go out and find creators, right, and maybe you want to go to like freelancing sites or you want to go to Twitter. Some of these creators in the e-commerce space think of UGC as like, I'm going to make a video for you, get paid like 500 bucks for you to run it as an ad. That's not the UGC we're doing. We're doing UGC where these creators post two to three times a day on a separate TikTok account that they warm up and will show you how to create accounts, warm them up properly, and then you can eventually train someone to do that. But we want people to post at least two to three times a day with visual hooks, text on screen hooks, skits, et cetera. So when it comes to UGC, you have skits or relatable stories. This kind of goes that turbo-learn approach where it was like, oh my god, my teachers don't know about this. App demos is usually like a text on screen or visual hook, which I'll walk you guys through, one for Twitter, one for raise, then goes into demo. And then another one is like the hook where it's like a huge claim. And this is best for, honestly, I think UGC can rip for conversions if you find a style that works or you're in an industry that already has ripping styles and you can iterate on it. I never suggest fully copying anyone. I think that's retarded. However, like you can don't have to reinvent the wheel and you can iterate on it. You can't really do that. I don't want it for your app. How can you make it better? Transparently, which a lot of you guys probably know this, but I studied Blake and Zach's Influenza Marketing Strategy and put her own spin to it. We started paying people 20% of the front and say the full contract size. We had to make custom tailored video ideas for the influencers because we didn't have one feature that would basically stop people from scrolling and download the app. So going into organic content, right? So we went through faceless right here. Here's one. This is an app called Conch AI. They are a basically Chrome plugin for Chat GBT, but this is my buddy Jude. So he said this absurd. Someone please help me. That's exactly why I made this website called I really don't want to write this paper. You'd be prompt to add some roughen sources and add your old essay. So keep in mind this, I don't really want it to paper.com was a viral format at the time. A lot of people in the space were ripping this format and getting a ton of views and say iterate it on it. But as you can see guys, they're posting two or three times a day on their main account, which you can do as well, where you can create separate TikToks and Instagrams. But they test everything. Look at all the fucking hoaxer texting. Look at all the fucking styles they're testing, people. And now not everything goes viral, but then next thing you know, they have up here, if I show you, they have 15 million views. That probably made them hundreds of thousands of dollars just because they were consistent and disciplined with posting. Another one, I would say, is that space, so let's don't need that. Okay, the raise app that we talked about. So this is a visual and text on the screen hook, right? It's visual because she just got out of the shower. You can see she has tan lines and then she's saying how to get tan and then in parentheses, if you never get tan. And then she shows the app. It's a direct plug of the app. And she shows how it works and then all these girls downloaded this because I want to use this. And then if you look at her account, she only has 1,500 followers, but there's so many of these posts of girls. My hunch is they probably like hide-and-match girls have filmed videos and they did the posting to make it easier. But like here we go, UV9 no problem. But also like if you see here, like look, it kind of looks like she's fucking naked, right? That's a visual hook. People stop and like what the fuck? But it shows the app. And so they keep posting 2 to 3 times a day consistently to get to work. Turbo learn, right? This was a viral strategy. You know this because when she goes through this whole thing, you don't even listen to it yet. She shows Turbo learn, right? And this is like one of those fucking like crystal girls, like bullshit, whatever. But this girl is 15,000 followers now and she's a Turbo AI diva. That's like her brand. She's been posting so much but she tried all of these styles, 14K, 13K, 121K. And the one we watch I think got 10 million, yeah right here. So she iterated on that style and that's iterated on more but she doesn't rip 10 millions of views of every single video. She has to test and study. So another one is for Quitter, right? So we realize that if you have a visual hook of lotion or tissues, etc., it'll go viral. So this was one, he was caught gooning, right? Stage that. This was morning routine addicted to corn, like show the thing, show all the visual hooks. And then what happens? Most guys have fucking post-loc clarity, clarity. I hate lust, right? POV, this is you after work. But we test so many fucking styles. Like we have to test everything to see if it'll work. All right, that is UGC, right? I would make sure you guys understand you want to post two to three times a day on your account after you warm it up. You usually warm up your account for four days roughly by acting like a real user and we'll have a very extensive walkthrough and how you can do that. But generally speaking, like look at what other apps are doing in space. See what's working and how can you iterate it for your own app. That is probably the best advice I can give anyone if they're looking to go viral and organic, right? Everyone people tell you, oh, I can do it for you. You can hire an agency, but none of that stuff generally works. I would just say final works for you. You guys try it yourself, rip it, and eventually you can start hiring people to do it. Now if you have the cash to hire someone, there are a bunch of resources we'll be giving at the end of distribution. Who you can hire, we'll recommend. And I guess best thoughts to go about doing it. I lost the word of my head. But, okay, read it. So, we didn't go over Reddit case studies because I think Reddit is very niche and but it can work well. When we started Quitter, the first thing we're doing was Reddit. And so just realize that the Reddit guys is a lot of your accounts will get banned. A lot of the times you get kicked out of these subreddits because they're going to realize that you're pushing these apps and they don't want shit pushed. There's very strong Reddit communities. But the purpose of Reddit is to do storytelling posts where you build this like rock hitting rock bottom. The app is the hero and you found it and you make it for your organic so it seems like someone's really posted about it and you're not like hard pushing and hard selling your app. I would say for like a week or two just talking communities as a normal person and you push the app. You can also go on some sites and buy Reddit accounts with exists in karma. So generally it was I was struggling with blank until I tried this. That can generally be too pushy. But if you build this into a story, you're good. And guess what? You can use AI to help you out. Don't make this harder than it has to be. And so for example, this is one that we had to go vile for quitter. So not sure when it became controversial to say this maybe it always was but porn is absolutely warped how people see love sex and relationships. Keep in mind this is a sex gender and dating subreddit. It doesn't matter that it's been around forever. So I have a lot of things we've rightly left behind. No one who's built anything meaningful legacy. This also looks like it's written by an idiot. I think we did that on purpose because I came and fucking read it. But it comes down to me a lot. I say we're from it the more obviously became porn is mental junk food zero. And then we edited it. And if anyone if it's of any help to someone I personally use quitter, right? So they plug quitter at the end. This is about being a Christian. It was severe point. He edited it. We found this app so we posted it at ripped views and then we. You know how come any. Why a lot of Christian men Alex is going to come and say what's up. Mr. Slaser itself. We're going over our quitter reddit high level. Why a lot of Christian men fail at falling to porn. And then we edit it after it rips views and say that quitter is what helps them. And so it became super organic. A lot of the moderators wouldn't get rid of this and then we'd rip fucking engagement and then we'd edit quitter in there and it would stay. Last one we're going over is X right so previously Twitter. So X is fun because it can be cheap and really effective if you put a lot of shots up. So you really want memes and day of thread. Those are the biggest ones. So like a meme for example would be right here. So one meme is like anti porn quitter contripsing little tas account getting banned for child safety. This was July 25th. So like little T was like basically saying hey I'm going to drop only fans and we always advance to with her on Twitter and be like you shouldn't drop an only fans X Y and Z and then we I'm pretty sure paid this person a post this. We did anti corn app right porn quitter seeks to buy only fans shut down like 125k. We said J calls down to Twitter. We paid all of these accounts generally like couple hundred bucks to post this. So here's the biggest one everyone saw anti porn app quitter seeks to buy only fans shut it down. It's got 11 million fucking impressions. This guy probably brought in like a hundred grand 200 grand over the course of a week off of this alone and then we put the link here. I got almost a million impressions. Now this one's super viral. People to this day are always like you guys going to buy only fans. It's like yeah I have a cool 5 billion laying around and some people think we're real and I'm like you're an idiot. But what I would say is dude people know this but we paid this account like a hundred bucks because he posts like 20 times a day. But he's doing is charging 50 to 100 bucks per Twitter thread or Twitter post and we know that he already has followers and so he is more likely to a viral. Another one I would say and show is like this. So we paid this masculine page right to do a thread on us. And what they did was show that porn is the worst drug for young men and here's why and people tend to read this stuff and it goes through like clips of what it does, how it affects you and then eventually goes like you want to quit porn here's quitter. And so you're only paying a couple hundred bucks for this stuff and you can also apply the same view guarantee model to it. So you're putting a lot of shots on net for Twitter X and what this will do is build a story and reach and drive conversions. I did in a day like the more people that have seen your app understand your app and know what it is are likely to convert on the next push right. So if you have someone that sees it five or six times I have a download on that seventh eighth ninth time they've seen it like I need to download this or we realize with quitter people tended men young men specifically tended to download our app at night because they probably just jerked off they post not clear to have to delete this thing and get off this. What can you do to help they know quitter. So generally speaking right understand that each piece of organic content has its own role in the funnel. However, you got to should know that there is a chance that it could be the main role. So faceless generally like we use faceless as awareness right and hit volume. Does it drive downloads? Yes, but you need more shots on net with that you have to post a tumour volume. For example, influencers, influencers one post could drive a ton of value. Like our faceless video for quitter I think I showed you guys this if I go to quitter. So this reel that we posted we post a lot of these right we put a lot of these different sour things for testing around. This one that got 2 million views because it was like 1.2 million views for how much you goon. I don't honestly know this converted a lot but guess what people know quitter is people are fucking commenting out the wazoo and liking this thing it's hilarious and they're like what's quitter and then they'll see an influencer post or they'll see an organic post and convert. So faceless generally is good for awareness and from there you will drive downloads. UGC I think is fucking amazing especially if you can crack it for your industry because it's real people doing it and people trust real people. Reddit I think is when you're starting off it's great it's gritty it's story driven you can get your first couple thousand dollars a ten thousand dollars months from it especially if you find that it's subreddits X as well it's something that's on the cheaper end but you really have to understand the algorithm in your industry and how to invoke an emotion. If you can pull an emotion out of Reddit and X you will win those games like fuck it actually you can pull an emotion out of faceless you just read it and X you will win right think about what do you want the viewer to feel what's going to stop them from scrolling make them read your content and build trust with you. So

All right, here we go. Setting up your account, all right? Everyone over thinks this, it's very simple. All you're looking to do is have clarity and trust within your branded account on Instagram and TikTok. So first things first, clear logo. Don't over complicate it. Don't make it something stupid. Just have a clear logo of what you guys are. Next thing is, right? Call AI is a calorie tracker, quitter is how you quit porn. Next thing we say is, Call AI has fast, simple and accurate, right? There's three value ads. Our value is you quit porn in 30 days. And then social validation. We have over a million happy users, Call AI is over five million happy users. Now, if you don't have over a million happy users, you can say over 10,000 happy users. You can use other things to show you social validation. At the end of the day, you just want to position yourself as a authentic, real and trustworthy solution in space. Because when someone looks at your organic content, you can repost and account your influence or content. They're going to come to your account and be like, oh, wow, they're legit. They're not just some random app. And a lot of this time, you can supercharge this with your distributions. You can have influence or swallow your page, influence or collaborate on posts. When it comes to collaborative posts, I would highly recommend waiting for the influencer to post and wait a week before you said collaborate on it. Because they could stump engagement if your account doesn't have enough reach. And then I would do the same thing for TikTok.

Alright, here we go. Now that you know the types of organic content, how to set up your actual profiles, which was pretty short for a minute long, let's talk about how to get set up for organic accounts and how to actually warm them up properly. I highly suggest doing this for anything with organic volume posting. That means you are making multiple TikTok accounts and posting two, three times a day or faceless, which is the same thing. You are posting two, three times a day, but just with the edited content. Now, the first thing is obviously download TikTok and create your account. Even if you are launching in a week, two, three, four weeks, I would download TikTok right away, make sure your account is warm, and start making videos that you actually get comfortable doing this. When it comes to your user names, alright, here's the deal. Make it something organic. I gave an example for Quitter. So, your name was Jack, Quitwood Jack, Jack. Quitter, Jack's Journey, or you could even just do Jack Jones 1, 2, 3. Make it simple. You don't need to overthink it. I would just use a first name, last name. You can even make it a fake name, and I would make it a clear profile picture. When it comes to the bio, I think you can do really anything you want. I've seen a lot of people do like my journey to quitting. Just no shame to support. It's actually something someone usefully enough in our Discord community for organic content. Sounds like AI, so maybe they use that. But you don't want the profile to look like a scam, like an ad. You want to make it look like a real person. When it comes to the timeline of warming up your account, here's what you do. You need to take three to four days and give it a commitment of at least 15 minutes a day, morning, lunch, afternoon, evening. What you're going to be doing is searching up content like in Contemplating Gaging. For 15 minutes, or it's 45 minutes a day, or 30 to 45 minutes a day, split up three times. Just make sure TikTok knows you, thinks you're an actual account, and trust you. When it comes to this, I gave an example for Quitter. I think it's the best thing to do. I'll actually just give examples of what we were doing. We looked at porn addiction recovery, dopamine detox, men's mental health, breaking bad habits, benefits of quitting porn, how to break lust, how to quit lust. We looked at men's masculinity, male masculinity. Then our feed was everything about becoming a better man, quitting lust, quitting porn. It was filled with self-development creators, religious creators, et cetera. You do this, as you like posts, you comment, you save, and then also on top of that, it's really important to click three dots and say, not interested for posts, you're not interested in. Another thing I'd highly recommend is reposting videos and leave comments. You might think that like comment, engage, save, share, et cetera is enough. I really recommend reposting and leaving comments because then actually TikTok will be like, okay, this is a real person. You're acting like a consumer on the algorithm. You're going to get trusted by TikTok, and then they're actually going to push your videos because you are playing their game. As I said before, mark any content as not interested to train the algorithm that you're not interested in those accounts. After four days, you need to scroll through your 4u page and out of 10 videos, eat and need to be in your niche. If you eat in your niche, which is 80% of your 4u page, then you are good. You are ready to post. I highly recommend posting two to three times a day, morning, lunch after noon. We should have spread out at least four or five hours. Your set, man, or girls. The last thing I'd say is you want to keep it warm. This is maintenance. Especially when you're posting, don't just open the app, post your video, delete it. Open the app, scroll for a minute or two, post a video, scroll for a minute, two, send a comment, and then you're good. Spend some time engaging in the niche videos, maybe liking, commenting, reposting videos, so that TikTok always thinks that you are an actual person. If you are getting under 100 views consistently, you are probably getting shadow band and TikTok does not think you are a real person, so you might want to create a new account and warm it up. We've already gone over this, but post three videos a day. Max, I would do his four, but I really think you guys should sit in the two to three days. Two to three videos a day, sweet spot. I would space them at least two hours apart, but I recommend four to five. Post before 10AM and then add captions, hashtags, and on screen text. When it comes to on screen text, talk to that before, on screen hooks that you guys have seen, hashtags, any relevant hashtags in your niche, and then captions, I always like to say quit a corn emoji with at quitter app, and so depending on your app, does the value is, you can just tag your app in there and make sure that it's being pushed. Lastly, look, just summarizing this. You want a three to four days of engaging in wanting to be your account. Your four-upage needs to be 80% of content, begin posting, and then make sure you engage every single day to maintain trust and growth. At the end of the day, this will help you be best prepared to rip millions of views and drive downloads and growth for your app guys. That is how to warm up your organic accounts and make sure you can also use this. Make sure you guys know that you can also use this for faceless. To warm up your accounts for faceless. So let's rip.

So this next section of the course, we are going to be talking about Pay Per Click ads. So this is Facebook ads, meta ads, Google ads, app love and ads, app store search ads, the whole nine yards. So here are our first case studies we're going to go through. So these apps are both primarily being found by people through their paper click ads. So Bible Chat, they're making 700k a month. Let's go check out their Facebook ad library. So 700k a month. Let's see what kind of ads they're on. One of these like cool aesthetic, almost motivational type of videos. The first week of at 7am, all of this stuff they have a few ads running right now. Christian cartoons bring Bible years to life. Some AI cartoons. But she's still remembered who she truly was. What's the most beautiful stories on your Bible? That's any Christian cartoons bring Bible heroes to life. By the way, these ads are all active. As you can see, it doesn't mean they're all profitable. It just means they're active. And we're going to go through the fact that these actually started running today. So that tells you something about Bible Chat. It means that they are constantly testing new creatives. These three ads were uploaded today. And the total active time this is important. If it's been active for like a couple of weeks or something, then most likely the ad is profitable. And also I wanted to mention, so this platform, I know I just jumped right in, but to take a step back, it is the Facebook ad library. You're able to see the ads that any brand is running through the meta ad platform. And so this is how we're doing it for Bible Chat right now. The revenue verified through sensor tower and then the ads we can see on meta. So let's go towards the end. Total active time, 22 hours. Yes, so they just spam out content. And that's something we're going to go into. Creative is king for paid ads. You're going to want to make as many creatives as possible. And this is my example. I'm just throwing out words right now. We're going to dive into all of this, but right now I really just want to show kind of what's possible with paid ads. Yes, so they have like hundreds of ads that are active. It honestly, the fact that none of these are inactive makes me think that maybe they aren't, maybe they're doing a specific bidding strategy where they just throw ads in. They let the algorithm optimize, but they're not actually going in and removing things. But like, okay, let's see what the other views are. We're telling me I never need to put Bible on the box. Yes, just like a product demonstration. That's kind of cool. So, okay, a bunch of variations of ads. It seems like it's mostly like text on the screen and then it shows something. Life without God feels empty. You feel like you run out of text on the screen. Turn out to be meaningless. And some cool grass keeps you feeling exhausted. Per view. Like a story for that. You need to reach God and get close to him. If you are confused, get Bible chat and ask it anything to get answers from the Bible. So, let's Bible chat. Life is just not not to be a piece. And you should feel every day that you're trying your best. Without a demo. Things that turn out to be meaningless. 700k a month. They probably actually make closer to like a million a month. And then we got Opal. And I say that because I believe sensor tower, it shows the proceeds, which means after Apple's cut, so 700k after Apple's cut more like a million. Every single month guys, every single month. And this app, I don't know if you've seen it. Bible chat. It's a very simple app. They basically just plug chat GVT into into their app. And you can ask it for Bible versus and then ask questions about it. They actually built it out pretty well at this point where there's a lot of different sections. And yeah, it's a very good user experience. But it was not complicated at all to build that app. Or it would not become a kid at all to build something like that. Opal. Opal is a productivity app. It's all about reducing screen time. I actually love their onboarding flow. If you're curious about seeing like a masterclass in onboarding, I would look through theirs. Opal. So let's see what kind of ads they're on. Another one of these words like text on the screen. Probably again, I'm falling for. Yeah, like probably again, that's interesting. You are high on the most proven drug known to man right now. And it's called your phone. Drugs have always been and will always be technologies. Whether that's morphine being isolated from the poppy seed or I was very good audio. Go do it yourself and look. So the common thing between these two accounts that we just watched is that they both spam out creatives. I mean, look at this. This one was uploaded today. This one was uploaded yesterday. These two, these three were uploaded the day before. Creative is king. And that's a lesson we're going to get into. What I want you to take away from this segment right here that we just looked through is that with paper click ads, it is very possible to highly scale up your app. Really scale it, grow it. It is not saturated like many people think. You just need to know the right angles to attack the space. And so we're going to get into that. But there are so many apps that are making millions of dollars a month. And their ad libraries are public. So feel free to go search sensor tower for the apps and then go explore their ad libraries. Let's jump into the next section.

So there are many different channels to run paid ads on paper click ads. Meta, which is one of the most popular, if not the most popular, that was kind of the OG platform was Facebook ads. Now it's under the umbrella of Meta. This lets you run ads on Instagram in Reels, on Instagram Stories, Facebook as you're scrolling through the timeline, banner ads on the website, the whole nine yards. It's very inclusive. Their algorithm is by far one of the best. It's been around the longest. It's really really solid platform. Everything was pretty much based on this. Then we go to TikTok ads, which it's a little more simplistic. It's just ads directly in TikTok. There's a lot you could do here. You can do you can just post a video and it comes up as an ad. You can do a partnership ad. You can do this on Instagram too, by the way. It's called a Spark Ad where you have someone post from their account and then you put ads spend behind it. This is how you can branch influencer marketing and paper click marketing together. Apple search ads, which is not the first thing people think of when they think of search ads, or sorry, when they think of paper click ads in general. Apple search ads is actually really, really overlooked. There's a lot of potential there for new apps. It's basically just bidding on keywords. The reason it's so good is because it is the only platform where the attribution is one to one. Apple has all these privacy rules that really stop you from knowing exactly where your users came from knowing how profitable each channel was. Apple search ads is the one exception. In that platform, you can know and therefore it's a great one to run on because there's very little if any uncertainty. If it's profitable. It's also easy to settle and we'll get into that. Google ads, Google ads, there are a bunch of different ways to run Google ads. There are search ads, search term ads. So if you Google something, you could place a bid where you're like the highlighted first result, the sponsored first result. But what's more popular as of recently with apps is Google UAC ads and Google UAC ads are going to look this up. It is, they're basically universal app campaigns and they let you run, basically ads everywhere for your app. You can run, like you set it up once and then it will show the ads across all Google platforms. So it will show ads on the Google Play Store, it will show ads on YouTube, it will show ads on the Google Display Network which is basically ads running within other apps. Google search. So Google UAC is a big thing and I know many people that have apps doing millions of dollars a month and Google UAC is their biggest spender, biggest contributor to that. App love and app love is a platform that personally I never used but there's been a lot of buzz around it recently. There's some rumors like you have to be spending at least 30K a day in order to get on the platform. It's basically just running ads within other apps, running video ads within other apps. And I've heard good things but I've also heard bad things. I used very mixed. I wouldn't recommend really spending too much time thinking about this by the point that you would need to run app love and ads. Your app will already be very successful and you can hire someone to do it. And by the way, I do want you guys to take into account something is that I, with Cali, so we initially started out with influencer marketing exclusively. And then we decided hey, okay, we know there's big opportunity with paid ads as well. So we're going to keep doing what we're best at influencers. And then let's use an agency on the side to run our ads. And so we did that. It worked out decently well. We were spending a few thousand dollars a day profitably. But then with pretty much anything, I'm very against agencies long term. They're good for short term sometimes, but not long term. We decided we want to really start scaling this. And agency is they move too slow for our pace. Number one rule of business speed. And so we decided to take it in house. I started learning. I started watching a lot of podcasts talking on my friends who are great with paid ads. And where was that going with this? Oh, well, it we started running again. And there are a lot of ups and downs with paid ads. Some of the biggest problems come from the smallest things generally once you're set up. You're good to go and scale the only issues come from attribution issues, which we'll get into. Which is all about Apple's privacy rules. But the reason why I wanted to say that is because I started. I did not start the face. I did not start the ad platform. I did not set up initially running paper click ads for Cali. We had an engine to do it. Then I took over. I started it from scratch. However, we only scaled it so far before bringing in someone else to continue scaling in with us. And that's something you should honestly keep in mind for every section is you only need to know up to a certain point where you're making enough money or you could then hire someone to replace you. And that's basically what we did. We just waited until we were making enough where it made sense to bring someone on and the ads were going to pay for their salary. And so I'm going to teach you enough where you could get to that point. However, I'm definitely not a master at this. I'm definitely not the best in the world. I know how to get it going. I know how to hire for it higher. Some of the best in the world. Once you have it going. But keep in mind, this is going to be pretty high level. We're going to go through all the principal strategies. And we'll also talk about how you should hire someone at what point should hire someone to. So the last one here is Snapchat ads. And Snapchat ads, we've run them once. They weren't profitable for us. We're going to try them again. I think may have jumped the gun. Haven't done enough testing. But it's Snapchat stories or Snapchat spotlight as you're scrolling through. You can see ads. For some people, it's very profitable. Very profitable. It's a channel that most people don't actually look into. So your CPMs, I don't know why, but that includes CPM, your cost per thousand views is relatively inexpensive.

Okay, let's get into the high life. I feel like I'm doing this for all of my sections. I don't know. So high level, I'm trying to get your attention. You gotta lock in, wake up. You're here because you want to change the rest of your life. You want to live life on your own terms. And therefore, you have to focus. This is the information you've been looking for your whole life. Your whole life. You've known there's been something out there. You've known that there's been information that's just been hidden from you that would change your life. That if you knew this information, you could tap into it. And it would change the rest of your life. Expand your mind. Show you the secrets that they're hiding, that they don't teach you in school. This is it. This is your chance. This is your opportunity. We're not leaving anything off the table. Putting everything on, being extremely transparent with everything all of our systems. At our own risk that people are gonna, it's gonna make the space more competitive, but we believe that all tides rise together. So, high level heuristics, focus of paper click ads. So this basically applies for everything except Apple Search ads. And we're gonna have Apple Search ads we're gonna make its own section for, because it's very different than other platforms. But this is for meta ads, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, Snapchat ads, TikTok ads, I think look everything. Google slightly, Google for the video ads, but not I guess for everything else. Well, some of these apply. You'll know what applies and what doesn't. So the high level heuristics. In the past, you've wanted to be super hyperspecific, handhold the algorithm. These are the target customers I'm looking for. This is a sample set of them. Here's what they look like. Now go find more. You would make what's called a lookalike audience. You would tell it, you would give some data from your existing users and say, these are the people that have bought from me before. Go find more of them. At this point, the algorithms are so good that broad targeting is better. Where you don't really give anything. You just tell the algorithm, this is what I'm optimizing for. Now go. And so that's something to keep in mind throughout this whole thing is that you might hear a lot of buzzwords from people online talking about retargeting campaigns, and which is basically there are all kinds of campaigns actually where there's a retargeting campaign where if someone saw an ad but didn't convert, you show them another ad. And there's a way in Facebook where you could design a campaign specifically to be for retargeting. However, that's actually not the optimal strategy anymore. This is all for most people. By the way, before I continue, I just want to preface that. There are no fucking rules. What works for anyone else might not work for you. I'm showing you what generally works, what's generally believed, the theories, and what I've seen in my personal experience, what I've heard talking to other founders. However, I know for every case proving something, right? I know a counter example where someone does the complete opposite and it works for them. So keep in mind, don't hold anything too tightly. Keep all this information close and loose. Be ready to adapt, be fluid. So creative is greater than targeting tweaks. This is essentially saying the videos that you're creating is more important than telling Facebook, this is a retargeting campaign video. This video is to retarget viewers that have seen a previous ad. In the creative, if the video is saying something like, hey guys, you've probably seen this ad all over social media and blah blah blah, maybe you show a clip from it. If you haven't purchased already, I just wanted to announce there's a sell going on right now. Blah blah blah. If it's actually good, Facebook and all of these ad platforms will learn very, very quickly that it works well for retargeting and it will show, it will be used for that itself. You don't need to do anything. And so the algorithms are really taking a big load off of everyone's shoulders at this point. You don't need to do as much as you used to. You just need to make very high quality creatives and be very intentional about them and just test. Creative is king. The more videos you put out, we saw those examples with Opal and with Bible chat. They're posting new videos every single day. They're running new experiment ads every single day. So okay, I'm gonna actually go into everything affects everything first. Everything affects everything. So just like if you have two creatives, they might one might tee the user up. Like, hey guys, check out this new soap. It lets you wash your body 10 times faster and keeps you clean 10 times longer than other soaps. The person's scrolls. Then a different creative, different creative, the algorithm realizes, oh, this is actually really good for retargeting. It's like, hey guys, we're on sale right now, 50% off. And if you remove the first video, it could totally destroy the second videos performance because everything's working together. The algorithm will learn, okay, I'm gonna show this first video to the user and then I'm gonna hit them with the second. And so everything works together as a system. And if you start turning certain ads off, if you start editing the campaign, you could destroy it. And I'm not saying that is like, you don't, like I'm not saying that to scare you from adjusting things, definitely be willing to adjust things. But I say that to keep in mind, if you change something that you think doesn't really matter, but then your whole campaign just falls apart. It's because everything affects everything. Everything has an effect. The algorithm is making sure that all of these moving pieces move together. The last high level here is sick is to always optimize for the final conversion. So you will be able to choose what to optimize for on these platforms. The options are usually traffic, which just means getting people to download your app, getting as many people as possible to download. Well, actually traffic is more just getting people to see your app page. And there's installs, getting people to download your app. And then there is a event. Then it's a event base where you could choose an event that you've programmed in your app to send a signal back to the ad platform saying this event was triggered. And that's what you want to do. You want to make an event in your app for when someone purchases or starts a trial, something that you can directly measure. First of all, within the next 24 hours, and this is something to do with Apple's privacy rules, which we'll get into. But mostly because we want to train the algorithm to only find people that are going to buy. If we optimize for installs, then the ad platform will think, okay, I'm going to get this app as many fucking installs as possible. I don't care if they spend money. I don't care if they're low quality users. I just want to find people that go download apps. People that like to try different apps. So they go, target those people, they'll go download, you'll get a ton of installs. But they probably won't spend money. They might, but they are less likely to spend money. And if you target for the purchase event, usually when you do target for a purchase event, you'll see that the cost per download spikes up. However, the chance that they purchase is also extremely high, because meta is finding people that they think will convert, they're not finding people that they think will download. They're finding people. They're not finding people that they think will download. They're not finding people that they think will like the app. They're not finding people that are going to press a specific button, they're finding people exclusively that they think will click the fucking check out button and pay with their face ID, that's all they're optimizing for. and they block out everything else, zone it out. Keep these in mind as we move into the next sections and probably you probably actually want to watch this twice. This is going to be the most important section for all of paid ads. If you understand this, then you're basically ready. You're, I wouldn't say you're ready, but you're 80% of the way ready to actually just hiring someone. You want to understand the platform first, but these are the principles that you need to keep in mind and make sure that if you wanted to hire someone to run ads, they understand these as well. Moving on.

Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to, I almost did the fucking hammer thing, but I didn't, I stopped myself. I am going to show you guys how to set up your campaign structure. And we're gonna do this in Facebook. We're gonna set up a campaign. It is, so it's actually meta ads, not Facebook. So we'll run on both Facebook and Instagram when I'm about to teach you. And although I am just teaching you how to set up on meta, the setup is very, very similar for all platforms. So this will be applicable to TikTok, Google ads, everything else. It's slightly different, but this is, first of all, what my main expertise is, is meta ads. And also it's what I recommend starting with. So that's why I'm showing it. But everything I show here, it's pretty transferable. So let's jump into the platform. You're going to want to go to business.facebook.com. Actually, go to adsmanager.facebook.com and it will redirect you here. I don't, maybe business.facebook.com also goes here, but I know that link works. And you're gonna want to log in. So I'm gonna log into my account. I'm paused my record. I don't know. Oh, they can't, okay. You guys can't see my password nice. I thought for a second you were able to see it. Beautiful. Okay. Just log in, got some two factor authentication. You guys should be creating an account instead of logging into one unless you already have one. Okay. Trust this device. Boom. We are in. So when you get in, you will maybe see one thing like this. I mean, delete this. I could kind of show what you guys will see. Well, do I know how to delete it? Nice. Cool. So you'll see something like this. No results found. You have not created any ads yet. This is the campaign section of the Facebook ad manager. And there may be an odd. I don't think there's an onboarding, but if there isn't onboarding, there are all kinds of tutorials on getting set up on Facebook ads and getting to this step. But it should be straightforward as follow the instructions. Make sure you're with me here in the campaign step. So what we're going to want to do is create a new campaign. And I'm actually going to switch into the Cali icon because. Because up here are all of our ads. You could see we spent $374,000 in the last 30 days on meta ads. I don't know what we spent in the last week. What did we spend yesterday? Yesterday 9K, last 7 days 72K. I want to see last month. Last month 390. This month 2 to 6 months isn't over yet. Okay. Cool. But yeah, we've been scaling paid ads pretty heavily the last few months. We were never really taking it seriously until recently. But let's jump into this. Okay. Let's go to today. Let's go to. Going to hide everything. Okay. So you'll see like a blank thing. You won't see anything. And we're going to want to create a new campaign. This campaign is the campaign we will run our ads through. It is. It's your first campaign. This is where you are running paid ads to. You're going to be generating sales there here. The campaign objective. So this goes to one of the other things we were discussing before. How you go to awareness or just showing people stuff traffic. It's setting people to website. There's engagement where it's getting people to like the video leads, which I've been used. But I believe that's more for more for in person businesses. App promotion. That is what we want to do. Get people to install your app. We get app installs and app events tracked and then sales. And this is for e-commerce source. So we'll do app promotion. We'll continue going through. You should name it. Like whatever you want really like there is a bunch of structure that you could really go deep into in the details of naming conventions to make sure you're super organized for this. Since it's just your first campaign, it doesn't matter. Again, what I'm teaching you guys is how to get it off the ground so that someone can eventually take it off your hands or you could build upon the knowledge yourself. So here I wouldn't stress about it, but name it something. Name it something good like. I would name it like Cali. I campaign one. Shit. Campaign one. But do whatever you want. Yeah. I'm going to call it test for this case. You know what tutorial. Campaign. All right. I'm really overcomking them. So we're going to go through campaign details, buying type auction. Nice. We do want to keep it like that. Campaign objective app promotion. That's good. See show more settings. A spending limit. None. None right now. We don't want to set a spending limit. So campaign budget. We want to switch this. There are two concepts here. It's CBO and ABO. CBO is campaign budget optimization. ABO is ad set budget optimization. And the difference is if you choose campaign budget optimization, you'll see first we're creating this campaign. And then within the campaign we create ad sets. And within ad sets you'll have the unique ads, the unique videos. That's how it is structured. So you can see if you're campaign ad sets ads. And if you choose campaign budget optimization, you set the budget at the campaign level. And then algorithm will determine how much to spend in each ad set, based on what it thinks will perform the best. But because we are just getting started, we want to have two ad sets. A testers ad set. And a winners ad set. And I'll get more into why we're going to add them, how they're going to work together. But essentially the tester's ad set is going to be spending less money every day. It's going to be where we just throw in creatives that we think will work, will convert. And the winning ad set will be all of the ads that perform well in the testing ad set. We'll move them from testing to winners. So let's go to ad set budget. iOS 14 plus campaign. We need to put that on this is due to apples privacy rules. If we have this off, we will not deliver ads to people with iOS 14 plus. And how many people, how many iPhone users are on iPhone iOS 14 plus? Okay, more than 72%. I think it's actually a lot more than this. Let's see. Yeah. So it's like at this point, there's like maybe 0.5%, maybe 1% of people max using iOS 14 plus. So you can see 96% of people already switched iOS 15 from 14. And that number is just going to keep going up. So very few people you'll be targeting very, very few people. And so even though you'll be able to get more in-depth attribution tracking, you will not be targeting people new phones. And if you're not targeting people new phones, iOS 14 was on phones like five years ago or something. If you're targeting people with phones from five years ago, you will bet. You better bet that they're not going to buy your product. They do not have money to spend. So you will need to select the app that you want people to use and install. This is something you'll have to set up. Let's see. If I can't find my app, so you will need to set up your app on Meta for developers. Whoops. So let's go through this. I'm not going to do all of this again. It's looking very annoying, but I'll show you. Set up your app on Meta for developers. That was my speech-ify plugin. Know the founder of this cliff? Really, really cool. Set up your app on Meta for developers. Whoops. Okay. Get started with app events on iOS. So just follow this guide, developers at facebook.com slash docs, slash app, whatever you see here. Just go copy that and go through the tutorial to basically set up your app. And you will also want to... You'll need to do a little bit of coding within your app to completely set it up. But it's nothing crazy. It shows you step by step how to do everything. Cool. So either do it yourself or send it to your developer or whatever you're using. And for the sake of this tutorial, we're only showing iOS ads and Android is a whole new story. So, okay. Make sure you set up your app. After you set up your app, it should show here. So here we go. Kalei. Boom. Click on it. Hopefully it's not sensitive showing my app ID. I don't imagine it would be, but... Okay. We go through. And now we hit next. No, they're settings. We want to change. Now we are in the ad set level. And like I explained before, we want a testers ad set. And a winner's ad set. So for the testers, I recommend you start minimum $20 a day. And for the winners ad set, I suggest a minimum of 100. But actually the winners, it's a little more nuanced. So we're going to get to that later. But for the testers, $20 a day, something important for you to understand is this idea of a learning phase. When you first create an ad on Facebook ads, when you first have an ad running, you just go through this learning phase where until it gets 50 events, 50 conversions, 50, whatever you're optimizing for, it will basically still be in this learning phase. And technically the algorithm hasn't found it's like core target, core demographic yet. And on $20 a day, we're going to assume, so first of all, we're going to get to this in a second. And I don't actually, this will make more sense. So I'm going to put a fucking pin in here. Let's just go through. So $20 a day. And our, which we didn't actually put yet, but performance goal maximized the number of app installs. So that's what it is by default. We want to maximize for the number of app events. This is something that you're going to have to set up with your MMP, which should be in the development section of the course. So there are plenty of tutorials, apps, flyer, and adjust are the two biggest ones. And the event we want to use is the, it's going to either be purchase, subscribe, or for our sake, for Cali, we do start trial. And the reason we do start trial and not purchase or not conversion is because you want as much data, you want to try to keep all data that's sent back a 24 hour window. If it's within a 24 hour window, you will have the least data drop off. This is another thing with Apple's privacy thing, where it's pretty fucking annoying. If you have a three day trial, and you wait three days to send back, okay, this person did subscribe, a lot of that data actually can be lost. So you want to try to get everything back as soon as possible within 24 hours. And this has to do with attribution windows. There's one day click and seven day click. If you do seven day click, then technically you can still get data three days later. If you do one day click, you cannot. And I believe that's somewhere down here that we're going to set. But just do make sure it's set to an event that happens within 24 hours. This is partially for getting data back clean with Apple's privacy things, not blocking us. But then secondly, it's so that the algorithm can learn faster. If it has to wait three days to get results of, is this a good, is this someone who will purchase or not? Then your learning will be very, very slow. It will take a long time to figure out who likes your product. So that's what I recommend. Is either store trial or if you don't have a free trial, then just purchase is also okay. And if you're a premium app, then it's more difficult. That is something where you may want to optimize for some kind of product. Or some kind of core event that happens in the first 24 hours. That causes, or that has a heavy correlation with the user being very likely to end up paying. That's more complex though. I recommend for all of your apps, you basically hard paywall, which means put the paywall right away up front. That at least works the best for paid ads influence marketing. Because you'll have direct attribution, you'll know right away. Okay, like was this video profitable? Was it not? If you have premium, it gets a lot more convoluted because then cohorts will convert over longer time horizons and you have slower learnings. So we're optimizing for the store trial. And now going back to this. So there's this idea of a cost per result. It's the cost per whatever event you set. Our cost per result. It's the cost of the start trial event. And for new apps, it's probably going to be pretty high. Your app is probably not going to be super optimized. And therefore, you could assume your cost per result. It's going to be in the tens of, it very much so depends. Very determinant on your price, your onboarding flow, how much people want it, how much competition you have, the price of your competitors, all of that. And something with paid ads, actually specifically, as people who is recommend doing a really high price, like $100 a year subscriptions. And a lot of people believe if you don't price higher than like $70 a year, you just can't scale paid ads. With Cal AI, we found that's not true. We sell $30 a year subscriptions, and we are very profitable with paid ads. But that is something a lot of people say. And that's just because some industries are so saturated that your customer acquisition cost or your cost per result, actually in this case, will be so much higher than your price. And so you have to increase your price in order for it to be profitable. And generally, as you increase your price, the cost per result will increase as well. If you lower it, it will generally lower as well. Then it's like, this is weird curve, it will plateau at some point or whatever. Okay. So the $20 per day, assuming that your cost per result is like $10. And that's the cost per result of a Cal AI trial start about, that's what we optimize for us. So yours is probably actually going to be worse than that. I imagine because your app isn't going to be optimized right away. Again, it does depend on so many things like your price. But you want to make sure that you're spending enough in the test ad set, where you will, you don't necessarily need to get out of the learning phase right away, because you could still see generally what, how ads are performing without being out of learning phase, for starting out, for like the first few tests you run. So I'd suggest starting low, maybe like $20 a day on your test ad set. And then through that, you'll be able to see, okay, which ads have the lowest cost per result. And then after you see kind of what your cost per result ends up being the lowest cost per result possible, because like let's say your cost per result really is $10. That will take, you need 50 conversions to get out of it. You're getting two conversions a day, if you're only spending $20 a day. So it's going to take 25 days. It's three and a half weeks. And we're not waiting three and a half weeks to know if a test is, if an ad is profitable. So we're going to run a few ads on this low, on this limited budget, see which ones do well, double down on those creatives. So we're going to talk about creatives in the next module. But essentially you're going to want to just test all kinds of different angles, see what does go double down. Once you've found the angles that you think works the best, and you see what your cost per result, kind of the lowest cost per result possible is, then it's, then you have to raise your budgets, so that you're getting at least 50 conversions a week. Otherwise, you're not going to be able to move fast enough. So that's why paid ads is difficult to start. It's also expensive to start. It may not be the best thing for everyone, if you're on a very tight budget. But you might need to be spending $100 a day on your tester's ad set, just to see if stuff is profitable. Just to test. And that's not even, like the goal of the tester's ad set isn't even trying to be profitable. We're going to get more into this. So let's keep going through. Cost per result goal. This is something where you can basically tell the algorithm, I'm trying to keep my cost per result goal around this number. And it's not something I recommend starting with. If your cost per result goal is extremely high, you could play around trying things out here. Some people swear against this, because they think, okay, if you put your cost per result goal here, meta will try to keep it profitable, but decrease the margin, so you're not making it profitable. But decrease the margin, so you're not making it as much profit, but it's still getting you that goal. These are like some theories and loopholes about how the algorithm works. We are using it on some campaigns for CaliI, and it's been working kind of well for us. It's interesting, like the slightest change. You change it half a dollar in your cost per result goal, and it will drop or increase the cost per result, like the spending to actually, this is cost per result goal. This is not cost cap. So that's actually different when I was saying for CaliI. We do something called cost caps, where we literally don't let it spend more than a certain amount to acquire a customer. So, okay, cost per result goal. You don't put anything. This is what I was saying about the attribution settings. You could have seven a click or one day click. Generally, one day click is better for faster learnings. I would actually suggest starting on one day click, because then the algorithm will learn fast. If you're only sending data back in the 24 hour window, if you do have a three day trial, and you're going to optimize on a conversion at the end of the three day trial, which for some apps, like I said in the beginning, nothing is what you have to do. These are all just generally what works the best for my experience. So you could try that. I definitely encourage experimentation. One day click, I was just starting with. Because that's how you can get the fastest learnings. The algorithm will learn the fastest to find your core users. So daily budget is the tester. So, yo, $20 a day. Start day and date none. Blah blah blah. No saved audience or anything. Okay. Locations, inclusion. So right now, I guess we have a default to the US is what we do for Kali. That may be best honestly. For, yeah, that's, I would recommend doing that. Because what you'll eventually do is you'll have a bunch of different campaigns for different countries. The US always says the most money to spend. So I would suggest starting with just the US. Sometimes people like the bundle in Canada, because Canada consumers are similar to United States. So you could try both, but start with the US minimum age 18. This is something that's kind of important to do. Well, I guess it's the lowest you can do. But yeah, okay. Yeah, just keep it 18. It doesn't really matter. It's just like people that are under 18 have less money to spend. So, so low conversion rates, whatever. If you have a free trial, often times you may get a lot of people starting a trial that are young, but they won't actually convert from trial to paying if they're too young. Okay, we keep on going through. Keep on going through placements, blah blah. Okay. Boom, see apples, fucking privacy rules getting in the way of things. But all right, we're going to click next. And now we created our test add set. So now this is where we can upload our first ad. So test add one. Test add one. So in here, we're not actually going to upload it yet. This is this does you got to upload now that so I'll walk you through really quick. Now, actually, we will, we're going to publish this as is. I'm actually going to delete that test add. We probably could have just not launched with that. Okay, it's publishing the changes. Boom. So tutorial campaign we go in, we see the ad set. This should be the tester's ad set. If it loads, we shall see if it loads. Sometimes these platforms suck. Maybe my life is just so. Okay, testers add set. So budget $20 a day, you can change it here. And we're going to go inside. This is our first ad. So we do not want this ad actually. Let me edit this and delete it. Boom. Okay. Well, we do actually want to start creating ads. So you can see the testers campaign. You will want to create some ads. So name this ad. You could have done it back then. But okay, testers one. This is where you'll actually drop your ads. And I just just dropping. Like a few at a time that are different angles at least in the beginning. Maybe like try to record five to ten completely different angles. Just throw them all in the test add set. And the algorithm will figure out what is spending the best. And we're going to get into creatives in the next segment. But okay. So you don't need to do much manual upload single image or video. Something interesting you could do is custom product page, which we're going to get into later that can help you override Apple's privacy bullshit. Okay, I've actually p really badly. So yeah, after this, I'm going to take a break. So add creative boom. So add creative video ad. And then here you can upload it. I guess we have a bunch here. So yeah, you could click upload and send what I'm just going to put one in that we already have. You could edit it if you need to. It will show you what it will kind of look like. You'll want to write a primary text. And this is something you're going to need to experiment with. I recommend doing like a main call to action. It's actually see what we do on the main Calais once as a reference. So on the main Calais ads, we will write. Let's see. We write AI can now count your calories just from a photo. Calais turns the camera into a smart tracker giving you instant nutritional breakdowns. You can hit your goals without wasting time when manual logging. And the headline AI counts your food for you. So you could see what it looks like here. AI counts your food for you. AI can now count your calories. It looks like an organic post almost. This is what it looks like on Facebook. And then this is what it looks like on Instagram. So you could put whatever you want here. But yeah, the headline should be like short and sweet. The primary text is more of like a description of what your app is. And to be honest, this doesn't matter too much. Just try to sound really authentic with the brand messaging. Try not to sound like an ad. If you sound too much like an ad, you're not going to fucking convert. And that's the biggest thing at the end of the day. Everything to do with distribution and advertisement is a game of just coming off as authentic. If you write like, if you do the typical salesman stuff, and it's like, do you want to get in shape for the summer? Well, you need a Cal AI. And it's 20% off for the next few weeks. Buy it today. It's like no one's going to convert. Yes, a small amount will, but that sounds way worse. I'm being like, yo bro, it's time for that summer cut. Let's get on it at Cal AI. Something like that. It sounds way more authentic. And that's what people like to see at the end of the day in this world of internet marketing. People do not trust brands. You don't. It's the truth. So you have to sound like your cool guy. Sounds just like a cool dude. So write your primary text, write your headline, do whatever you want there. I showed you what we have. And then the call to action. Usually we do download download install. Now I don't think this matters. This is all stuff you can test and play around with. We actually didn't do much testing on this early on. We just wrote something and it's just stuck. So ask Judge VT to get some help. Short and sweet sound authentic. Okay, enhancements. I'm going to really look at this stuff. I just sit down. And there we go. Sad fucking music. But we could just keep adding new ads. Create ad. You just keep adding new ones. Duplicate whatever. And once you're done with all of that, you'll want to hit publish. I'm going to hit publish. It will put it here. Your campaign will need to be reviewed. It will say no ads for like 24 hours or something. While it's in review. Is it your ads have to process? Then it will go to like interview and whatever. You'll see all that happening. And then once all of it's done, it will finally start spending. And because the ad set is $20 a day, all of the ads in here. Essentially the algorithm will. It won't spend them. And necessarily it will usually pick out the best one and put like 90% of the budget into the best one. And the strategy essentially looks like what you'll want to do is just see whichever ad is getting the most money put into it. If the cost per result, which is. Where is the cost per result? Should be one of these. Is this it? Oh, okay, here we go. You could change these columns. You might, you might. Yeah, I don't know if your columns are probably not ordered like this. I realize you could go in here. Columns. Customize columns. And these are the columns that I have clicked actions. Mount spent click through impressions delivery reach results attribution setting. Cost per. That's one of the, that's probably the most important actually. App installs. Cool. So. That's it name whatever I don't, I think this stuff is default. And then I believe you could like move it around to in the customize and in the custom columns. So this is how I put it. I'll show you how much it's spending. And you'll want to rank all the ads you have after like a few days of it. Running $20 a day. You want to put highest to low spending. And whatever is the highest spending for some reason the algorithm really has a bias towards it. If the cost per result is super unprofitable, extremely unprofitable, we're not extreme, but if it's just pretty unprofitable, you will want to turn off the ad. You want to turn it off. And that will allow the algorithm to start spending in other ads. Because like I said, it will choose one and then just put all of the fuel into that one. And so if it's not profitable, you want to give the algorithm a chance to test the other ones. Generally, it's going to pick whatever will have the lowest cost per result. If that's what you're optimizing for. But it's still a good thing if you see like one of them is getting $19 a day and the other one are getting a few cents. They're probably not getting enough. It's, it's not necessarily enough testing done to know if it's profitable. Honestly, for the most time, it will be correct. The algorithm will work. So like in bulk, you can just start uploading a ton. You could upload up to 50 ads in an ad set, I believe. So you could just keep uploading. And then whichever is our gift, whichever is getting the most spend. It's probably going to have the lowest cost per result as well. So if you see that it's unprofitable, we turn it off. We upload new ones. If you see that, it's profitable. Usually by the way, what most people do is they'll wait until an ad gets $100 in spending. $100 in spending, unprofitably, then they'll turn it off. And if it's $100 in spending profitably, then they will move it to the winners ad set. And we're going to talk about that soon. But that's the strat right now. It's just like create a ton of different angles. If you see an angle, that's working really well. Create more content in that angle. And we're going to talk about creatives. If something is doing really good in testers, I would just starting to scale the testers ad set. What you'll want to do is scale up the budget from $20 daily to. Well, you'll want to go up 20 to 30%. Every like two days, two to three days, that is profitable. If you increase the budget more than 20 to 30%. More than 30%. Actually, it will go into learning again. And you don't want your ads to go into learning all the time because then that takes a while to get out of learning. It's not a bad thing every once in a while to go and learning, especially if your budget is high enough where you're getting the 50 conversions. Every single day. Then getting and learning is not a is not a problem. But if it's like $20 a day, you're spending. And so it's going to take weeks to get out of learning. It would be pretty devastating to put an ad back into learning. So it's going to hurt performance. It's going to hurt performance for a little. The algorithm will start like relearning what works. Almost from like, yeah, not from scratch, but it may throw things off for your ads performance. So I know I'm throwing a lot of just dense information at you. To bring it all down, what you're going to want to do is create the campaign, create the ad set as I showed you. In the testers ad set, you're just going to want to start throwing ads in here. And the ones that are doing good. You will want to. You'll want to keep if they get $100 in. Spend it and they're unprofitable. Let's turn them off. So then we will create another ad set. And this will be the winners. Winners ad set. So this will have the same things, but this will have more money. $100 a day. This ad set is for all of the ads that are actually profitable. It's for all the ads that worked in the testers. Anything that got $100 in spending and their cost per result was a profitable cost per result. What you'll want to do is this is inside the testers. You'll want to click duplicate existing campaign. Original campaign. Actually. On Zim not. Yeah, actually, no idea. We're going to figure this out. Duplicate existing campaign. Existing ads instead of the existing ads that we go to winners. So we'll duplicate it there. And what this will do is it will move over the ad to the winners campaign. So. Once you do that, I think it's the objective mismatch. Oh, the objective here was app events. We did not make it start trial. Okay, cool. That should get rid of the errors. We've got to save that. So now in winner since we moved it over, you will have the ad that we copied over. It copied everything. I'm going to go p-alder it back. Okay, I'm back. So I just changed this sheet right now. When the ad hits $100, we want to either turn it off or move it to the winners' ad. So I just wanted to clarify that on the sheet. The whole $20 thing and scaling. So just like full circle. I just want to collect our thoughts because this is super long module. We went through a lot. We went through a lot. Ideally, you can increase the tester's ad set from $20 a day to more. The reason you actually have to start at $20 should have mentioned this. When you first create an ad account, it limits you to like $50 a day max. And then the second week, you could do $150 a day. And then third week, maybe $200 or $300. It just keeps scaling. So you have to kind of start slow. You have to start slow. In terms of increasing the budget. You can do it for you should do it for both the testers and winners. But primarily, you're going to want to scale up the winners. Not necessarily the testers. Like the testers at the scale that you guys are going to be operating. You probably only need it at like $100 a couple hundred dollars a day max for a Cali. Let's look at our testers. I don't actually hours is very complicated. We have a lot of campaigns, but here's like, let's let's look at our amount spent. So okay, this is a testing campaign. And we spent $933 today. And today's not over yet. So this is probably unlike $2,000 a day to this one. To this one test campaign. And by the way, we're doing testing at the campaign level and not the ad set level, which is another difference. But this is more complex. You guys don't need to worry about this stuff. Cool. Yeah, just to like go through here. So you guys get some like value. I mean, this is like, so you'll see eventually as you start scaling, you'll be able to see the amount you're spending. The cost per result. And the cost per result. We're going to talk about this more. But it's because of Apple's privacy rules. They're never actually accurate. Usually they're about 50% better or it could be up to 50% better is usually the case. Budging impressions, click through it. That's like an important thing for creatives will get into. But all right, whatever. Can't give you guys. I think this is, I think this is a good amount of info for one module. Anything I'm forgetting. I don't know. Honestly, I might have missed stuff. I know that this specific module was confusing. It was a lot. A lot. I just threw it at you. And I want to reiterate, I'm not an expert at paid ads. We primarily grew. Callie, I threw influencer marketing. I started the paid ads. I spoke to a lot of founders to learn their strategies. And then I ultimately hired someone on the team to take over. So this should give you the ability to get started. And obviously finish the rest of the modules. You're not there yet. Slow down, motherfucker. But when you do finish it, you'll be able to get it started yourself. You'll be able to spend. You should be able to scale to a good amount of daily ad spend. Like with this strategy, you could probably scale to like five K a day. Before things are going to start like seriously getting fucked up and broken. But let's move on to the next step.

Okay, so before we move into the next section, which will be where I teach you how to create creatives, this section is going to go over a topic called creative fatigue, which is very important for you to learn. I explained how do you set up the campaign, how to test out your ads, see what's working, and then move it to winners. Now once it's in winners, you can't just assume it's going to work forever, because it will. Every ad has a lifespan, and every ad will eventually be exhausted and have something called creative fatigue. This is when it becomes unprofitable. If you try to spend more, if you try to scale it more, whatever the case, it was super, it was profitable for a while, days, weeks, sometimes even months, and then it slowly becomes less and less profitable until it's just not profitable anymore. This happens with all ads over a long enough time period. No creative is good enough to last indefinitely. And so what you're going to want to do is watch out for this. In the winners' ad set, if an ad is unprofitable for like one or two days, leave it. It's nothing to panic about. There are going to be fluctuations in depending on seasonality and all these different things, just a day-to-day basis you can't look at. But if an ad is unprofitable for an entire week, then it's time to remove it from the winners' ad set completely. Generally, they say you only want to turn ads on and off by clicking this toggle. They say you don't want to actually delete because that can mess up the algorithm. So that's what I would recommend doing. If you get to the point where, because you could only have 50 ads, if you get to the point where you've turned them off, then you've filled up all 50 spaces, which will take you a while to do. But once you've done that, then it's worth, you could create a second winners' ad set here. You could create four ad sets in a campaign. You could create a second winners, third winners, and if you exhaust all of those, you could create another campaign. But by that point, you'll probably want to hire someone who's a lot better than you to run it, or you'll have learned a lot more on your own. Let's get into creatives in the next topic.

Creative time baby. Let's fucking go did the punch cuz we're excited So there are a few things to keep in mind here. This is when by the way This is when everything we've spoken about we I showed you guys how to set up your campaigns How to upload ads now? We're going to show what makes a good ad There are three key metrics that make a good ad or that like measure good ads usually are is the hook rate Click the rate and the cost per result already showed you guys the cost per result Now let's define what a hook rate and click the rate is and by the way we will be going through all of the Cali I ads for this so I'm gonna be very open and transparent. We are showing you the fucking sauce. This is tangible This was $72,000 spent in the last seven days that you're gonna learn from If 2,300 ads running that just shows you creative is king You need to be fucking testing more creative the more creatives you test the more likely you are to find winners so Click through rate click through rate is right here Generally you want above a 1% click through it. That's usually a good sign and click through it by the way is The percentage of people that CD add and then click the action button So it's either like download app or learn more install whatever the core action is the key behavior That is to click through it and you'll see Honestly, like when I scroll through here I don't see the clearest correlation where the top ones are very high and the bottom ones are low I feel like it's like you could see here. It is low These are mostly below one at the top it's a lot higher than you also have like 4.82, but this ad isn't doing that well And I say that because one the cost per result is pretty high into it's not getting a lot of money spent on it And so none of these in isolation are that good to look at to be honest The next one is cost per result. That's arguably the most important you just want I mean, yeah, it's in my opinion the most important the lower the cost per result is the more profitable The ad is for you or the Yeah, the lower the lower the cost per result is the more profitable and Then you want to look at the hook rate the hook rate is I think define yet the first three seconds How many people last the first three seconds divided by impressions and This is actually custom metric so to create a custom metric you have to customize columns you have to You have to custom create custom metric hook rate Like three three seconds watched divided by impressions and What you want to do is Actually, let's see let's see what we had before At it Okay Three second view plays divided by impressions you just take the formula. Okay Hook rate What is it three three second whoa three second video plays divided by impressions and You want it as a percentage How great to Boom now look great to let's just confirm it matches the actual hook rate. Yeah, it does so we created it correctly So that's what you want to do to actually create the hook rate I'm just gonna delete mine because we do not need it Do not need to This is what I mean guys by like I didn't create this metric we hired someone to do it Marcus. He's a killer so Eventually you're gonna get to a point where you don't know worry about any of this stuff You'll just start doing things and then and then you'll hire someone if you really don't want to overcomicate this I would say only worry about cost per result that's bottom line all that matters that you have a good cost per result but the hook rate and the And the click through it is a good way to iterate on your creatives figure out okay What is working well what is hooking the users in? Generally there is a correlation here where the better the video is doing and by the way It's ranked from best horse if you couldn't tell already the better the video is doing the higher the hook rate you could see it Starts to drop as we scroll down now we're in the 30s and we were in the 60s Okay So let's see what types of creatives are killing it for Cali There are so many different ways and so many different types of creatives that you can make The whole goal is that you want to test as many as you can we have 2,373 ads running That just shows you I know first of all not all those are actually at are actually active right now But all of those were active at one point and that should show you how much testing It needs to go into this in order to really find success It's not gonna take 2000 to find one successful ad But if you want to really scale this up to spending half a million dollars a month on paid ads like we are profitably Then you need to be testing more creative is king the more creatives you test the more winners you'll find And there are so many different angles You'll just want to play around with all kinds of different hooks Like going back to that virality module in the beginning of this distribution course You want to use some of those you will want to Pay use influencer videos as actually ads. That's a big part of our strategy So in the contract you want to make sure that they sign away the rights for you to reuse it as an ad and You'll want to just start Testing as much as you can let's see what's working well for Cali This is our best performing ad we spent 10k in the last week And let's see what it was he's 18 years old It uses AI to count calories based on the food on your plate Cali eyes an app where you can track the calories you're eating just by taking a picture of your food I'm just taking a picture right now of my lunch Scan load and result. It's at 400 calories in this role. It picked up sushi rice salmon avocados spicy mayo sauce Cal AI registers 90% accuracy So that was just a cut of these 18 years ago There's a lot of social profere because it was on CBS news and that definitely helped and then I it was a live demonstration There's also this factor like some you have to lean into your strengths We paired two viral stories together one. It's it's viral that there's an app where you could take a picture of your food and it tells you the calories That's unprecedented now it's something where a lot of people maybe it's a less surprising because AI technology is getting better and better And a lot of people have heard about Cali eye apps where you could just take a picture of your food and get the calories However, it wasn't something you would imagine like a year ago But on top of that we paired it with my story the founder story that I'm 18 years old And I built an app that is making millions of dollars. That's viral that gets people watching And then they're like wow this team he built this app and I'm gonna get it. It's a cool app So you got to hook them in somehow In years old it uses AI to count calories First thing that said it is about me not the app. He's 18 years old Keep that in mind Second video this is the this is actually one of our influencers who Let's see For 12 short 10 minute 12 12 second video One of our influencers. I don't think we did any editing to this he posted it and It didn't go that viral on his own account But we're running it as an ad and getting a massive ROI on however much we paid him for it We're getting such a bigger term His ad it's super high-converting What we did here is wanted to hook It's like him working out you must eat so strict in quotes So the viewer knows oh does he not eat strict? How does he stay so lean them? And then it shows you the It gets straight to the point of what the app does it doesn't show oh first sign up for the app type in your name onboard and go through Take a picture it it goes straight into take a picture Picture load results for Cali. These are the three sequential screens that Explain what the app does in a really succinct way and shows the value proposition If you could figure that out for your app you'll be in a very good position before your ad creatives So So you'll see there are a lot of news ads that were just caught up of me I went on the news a lot and these news ads are honestly ripping. They're doing really good Cal AI a tractor calorie intake using artificial intelligence It's also one of the top health and fitness apps in apples app store It wasn't sustainable for my lifestyle to type in everything I was By the way about this already cut off the video I was the producer right before I went on the news segment told me my lights had a glare So I turned them off and I turned on these Lights in front of me instead, which I thought would look a lot better But it just made me look scary like look at this bro my entire room is tarth and I'm like a little figure But it's one of our best performing ads. So I don't know maybe there's something there Is eating so along with one of my co-founders We hypothesize that we could build an app where you could just take a picture of your food And then it will tell you the calories and macros of what you're eating the app has grown extraordinarily fast in just the last 12 months We have achieved more than 6 million downloads and the app is on track to make more than 30 million dollars over the next year I We do AI a traction So a bunch of other news ads that I'm going to skip because they're all like the same thing maybe just different slightly different clips me on different channels See This is another influencer if you want to go from looking like this to that All I did was a calorie deficit and the best way to make sure you're in that deficit is to track your calories Something like calorie eye here helps you track everything accurately by just taking pictures of what you eat That's what you don't got to worry about what you're eating and how much of it If you want to go to the video really well showing you before and after showing that's more of a UGC type video user generated content He himself is an influencer, but you get whether he's not that famous So whether he has a following or not a didn't really affect the views It's more that it was an authentic person giving their review of the app showing how it works for them showing he shows proof he shows how he went from very overweight to having a six-pack Okay, this one was more heavily edited by our editor and let's see what happens You This is just simple and straight to the point I'm honestly surprised that ad is doing that well. It's pretty impressive. How well it's doing What was it? There's this one. Yeah, it's doing pretty good getting a lot of ad spend behind it So So that's getting straight to the point that works News ads Let's see this one curious. Don't know what it is Okay, same guy that showed the transformation before Another transformation Oh Notice that it's hook and the hook is unrelated to the app and then it shows the app Not everything needs to be about your app. So don't get too caught up you could show it at the end and it could work Right now we're doing some experiments working with Michael churn out it's pretty famous or pretty popular guy if you're still using my fitness pal or your notes app to track your food You're wasting your time Calais and AI powered calorie tracking app that tells you the macros in your meals just by snapping a picture It's really that simple guys point your phone take a photo and in seconds you get protein carbs and fats everything It's so easy my kids have even started using it. I used to log every ingredient manually now It's just one photo and I'm done look if you're trying to eat cleaner lose weight or just tracks smarter check out cal ai There's a free trial and it's honestly a no-brainer if you're still using my fit So that one was definitely a little bit higher quality than most of our ads and Looking at this right now. It looks like it's not actually profitable at the moment this ad is early on So we're gonna see if it becomes profitable. It's getting a lot of spend, but not profitable We'll see if it turns around It actually you know what there's a chance it's profitable usually I say it's not profitable because the cost per result usually profitable for us is when the cost per results like under 20 dollars But this is over However, Michael turn out as an influencer that usually targets older audiences and so because of that it's possible that this ad is profitable And we could actually see the age demographic breakdown I think of his ad I'm basically what I'm saying is if he's targeting older audience they might be more likely to convert they might have a higher ltv Okay, so 35 to 44 It's 24 the average age. Okay, versus this ad Which is So Mostly younger so it is it is definitely hitting an older audience and it's possibly profitable So okay, let's watch like one more You I just Spanish ad to be honest. I don't know what it says, but it's working for our Spanish campaign You know you don't need to worry about Spanish for now Here's another one. I don't count calories. It takes too long and that shows Solving the problem because that was so similar you can make this in 30 minutes or less like probably like Two minutes if you're just grinding it out something else I want to go over is A static ad so this is when you just have an image And you can do something like we try the best calorie chakras here's our favorite And then you click learn more it takes you to the app or website or whatever So these static ads can actually work pretty well if some some company is heavily rely on them Others heavily rely on video for elsewhere mostly video oriented And just starting statics it looks like it's Not it's likely not profitable right now most of our statics look like they're not doing that good For apps honestly videos are probably the way to go But yeah, so we just have a lot of stuff here Let's look at some ads of some other apps So like I said before you could just go to the meta ad library all ads Facebook ad library Then you could start looking up stuff. So like opal cool cool app Cool ads Some text on the screen I've seen some really high quality opal ads. I wonder if I could find one I I'm seeing This is one of the best ads I've seen in a while It makes you feel very uncomfortable And that's the whole point of this ad because if you feel uncomfortable The jobs are high as you come come on pre so you can try it out for yourself You are the human but here you treat it like catalysts and data You've been reduced from a lot of people will picture on the planet who pair of eyeballs and a thumb This is by design Why do you think every single social media company created their own vertical video black Because it's insanely fucking addictive the college persuasive technology But it's in slatement four hours on your phone Well, like 10 years of your life Gone and what are you getting in return? It was never meant to be this way I was the bicycle of the mind men's take us further than we've ever been before The harness fire went to the moon There's all of them but the no smarter than you without a fucking title You've been given one chance to play this game of life and they're trying to trap you Here So this obviously isn't the actual ad this was a TikTok of a guy reacting to it But this ad I remember seeing it Before like it just came up naturally on my four-upage And it it called my attention. It's a very cool ad cinematic ads like that can work really well There is a trade-off where like we I showed that ad where someone just took a picture of an apple one of our best performing ads Ever that took 30 minutes or less whereas this probably took hours tens of hours maybe even a hundred hours And you don't know if it's going to be profitable at the end of the day you could spend we actually spent like 20k on an ad And it just wasn't wasn't profitable. We tried to do a really high quality one just was not profitable To be fair actually that ad we did it was a TV ad So it was very different than what we're going through right now. We were just dabbling in TV Not something you guys need to worry about right now You'll get there soon enough if you really have what it takes we'll see Our entrepreneur is born or can they be created? I don't know. I was actually thinking about this recently And I think I've came to an answer. I think that it's a lot of nature versus nurture where I think most of being an entrepreneur is nurture It's like risk tolerance a bunch of other things that all are affected when you're young for example risk tolerance If you are rewarded for taking risks when you're younger versus if you are It's opposite of rewarded like Um opposite word or punish I guess Antony You Okay, maybe there isn't a good one but punished as a kid Entrepreneurs naturally like everyone knows they have a high risk tolerance. They take a lot of risks most of them do at least And that's something that if you're younger you develop a low risk tolerance I think you could break that habit when you're older. It's just difficult to The longer you go before starting your entrepreneurial your entrepreneurial journey The harder I think it will be to get in the right mindset because there are some traits that are very necessary Um, I'd say the main ones are grit. It's just being willing to fail over and over and over again as you're watching this just Don't think you're gonna watch this and even though we've done this so many times we're giving you Spoon feeding you the secrets don't think you're gonna get it on your first time You're probably going to fail for your first couple of apps until one finally takes off and when that one takes off It's gonna blow up past any of your expectations if you stay in it I honestly was thinking about this the other day. I used to say when I was a like I mean I was give that to say when I was a kid, but I guess a lot of people look at me as a kid now, but I'm 18. I'm not a kid, but but I used to think I'm gonna be an entrepreneur or die trying. I don't want to work at 9 to 5 And I thought about this yesterday. I was like this kind of retarded like I think genuinely Anyone can find success as an entrepreneur. It's just a matter of trying enough things like you will It's almost impossible not to if you just don't give up because there's so much money to be made So many industries that are untapped people are making money off the dumbest things. I know people who are making six figures a year That literally just book restaurants seats in advance and then sell them as it gets close to the day There is so much money to be made in the world people just don't realize that Back to the point of this yet, so go through the ad library search up your favorite apps See if we get some any other cool ones I Don't invest is actually really cool popcorn. They aren't some nice news ads Would you sell your ownership in this particular app for a hundred million dollars you post? Oh definitely not definitely not a billion Definitely not So you want to refuse to walk away from this no matter what I want to welcome this for the rest of my life And I think the mission that we're trying to bring is we're really writing the investing playbook If you send Americans are not participating in the greatest world creation engine of our time to stop more than capitalism I know Steven the demand is pretty cr... I love him We've been out to dinner a bunch of times. This is a great guy. That is definitely cap He would sell his shares for a billion dollars if he won't then it's very commendable Maybe he cares about his company more than I think But now you got to say some extreme stuff for good ad creatives He actually told me it's funny. He goes on when he goes on ads when he when he goes on TV live TV He'll have a few lines ready that they know will work well for the paid ad and then they'll clip up these specific parts So that's what I started doing too when I go on these tv ads. I'll try some things something I actually did the last time I went on TV. I don't know if we tried it as an ad yet But I work two watches one on each wrist hoping that it's going to rage bait people in the comments To write like why the fuck is he wearing two watches that founder what a loser bubble up Because engagement on paid ads actually helps you get more and more reach just like on an organic post It will lower the cost per Person that sees it generally generally if you get good engagement Okay So feel free to just go around look through This slide goes through creatives pretty well I hope you have some good takeaways Mm, I got to relax now I'm tired. Did a lot of recording today Yeah, you guys got this you don't need me fucking just lock in This is some music spend like I know a lot of people that will spend One day a week and that whole day is just dedicated to making ad creatives They'll upload them they'll let them run for a week and they'll have a new battery like the next day of the week to put in Go have one filming day and then one uploading day the upload like 50 creatives every single week You don't need to do that at this scale, but like when you start scaling up 50 creatives a week is An ambitious goal. It's a good place to be that's when you'll start making millions of dollars among Cool I think that's actually everything for the traditional pay. It's not everything. Okay I'll see you guys in the next module

The most important part of running paper click ads is attribution. The most important part in 2025 and and onwards. This is because the algorithm is so good at this point, at finding people that will pay for your product. So the only two variables that you're really tweaking, aside from your app you're pricing, because that's all important, are the creatives and the attribution. Now attribution, if done wrong, will fuck up everything. If done right, then the algorithm will work amazingly, do what it's good at and find new customers. Adjust has a really good blog on what all these Apple privacy rules are, so I suggest reading this adjust.com slash glossary slash scan networks dash scan, and this will teach you a bunch of stuff, basically how it works. But let me go through this graph here. So first I would say pause this video, go read that. Once you've read that, come back here. Go. Okay, I'm assuming you've read that. So these are the this diagram right here shows us how Apple's scan SKAN, I don't know what a scan stands for. Scan network, store kit and network. LAM. So how works is very, very strange, very, very strange. I'm going to explain this to you and you're going to be puzzled why Apple would design their system in such a weird way that's so unintuitive and so confusing. So there are a few different post backs, one, two, and three. And these are the three opportunities you have to get data back from one of these ad platforms. When someone downloads your app from an ad, you have three different times where you can send an event back and train the algorithm on that. So the first post back is any event sent back from the user's device in the first two days. So for us, since we're going to train on trial started or purchased directly when they download, assuming it's a hard pay world app, like I explained earlier, we want an event being sent within 24 hours. It's really within 48 hours, honestly, if we're training with scan, we will. It will be part of the first post back if it's between the first 48 hours. And then it will, the event will be measured within the first 48 hours, but it will actually be sent to Facebook 24 to 40 hours later sporadically during that time. Why? Who the fuck knows? Ask Apple. The second post back window is between days three and seven. And after day seven, then randomly it between the next 24 and 144 hours. Oh, oh, I just lost the course. Okay. Between the next 24 and 144 hours, which is, which is six days, you will get the second post back events. And then there is the last post back window, which is post back three, third post back. This is any event collected within the first eight to 35 days. And it will also be sent one to six days later after the 35th day, which is very, very strange. I honestly don't know why they're doing this. A lot of people have said they've added all of these privacy rules because they were sued by the EU and they now have to do this for device privacy. But it doesn't make sense to me that they would need to do this weird, weird fucking shit, dude. I don't know why they have to, but whatever we have to deal with it makes it more difficult for the competition. So the first post back and second and third for each of them, there is something called a conversion value, a low medium high pay no attention to low medium or high. It's really just like one, two or three. And for each one, you map a value to it. So we map install free trial and conversion. These are the only three events you can really track. And then there's a second post back and a third post back. In some cases, I don't know if it just does this actually it might. If you get multiple events, it may only send, it may go by magnitude. So if low and medium is sent, only medium will be sent. If low medium high is sent, then only high will be sent. That I know is how some of these attribution platforms work. So look into it for the platform you're using, adjust or actually confirming this right now. Honestly, they're we are. I wouldn't necessarily worry about this right now. This is more of the nuances to be honest. But the first post back is something interesting about it that the rest don't. The first post back has these fine conversion values. And these are bits. Why are they bits? I don't know. But they're essentially just an extension of these other values. And so you can have extra events in the first post back, six extra events that you can't have in the second or third post back. The difference is with bits and the conversion values is that you have to hit a certain threshold of down. In order for you to even get the value from the bit. What is the threshold? I'm actually not sure. Let's let's see if chat you to knows. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Okay, so there is a threshold that Apple apparently does not send it, which is ridiculous, which is ridiculous. So if the bits don't get sent over, then it will fall back and only send the low medium or high. If you get bits does it not send the low medium high? Let's see. Wow. So you don't get both at the same time. So Apple has this fucking privacy threshold that no one really knows what it means. And if it's hit, then you will only get the bits. If it's not hit, you only get the conversion, the rough conversion values. So yeah, that is pretty bad. It's pretty bad. Honestly, it's pretty stupid. Scan. So everything with measuring scan. In the ad library, the cost per result, you'd actually see that it goes down over time because the first two days it will look completely unprofitable. For the first two days, it will look completely unprofitable until the event starts sending in and then it will start filling in the cost per result will actually start dropping. And that's that's a known. It's very annoying. So the workaround that we do at Cali scan is very good for measurement because Apple won't overestimate the amount of people that go through. It will underestimate the number of events that this sends. It actually can be up to 50% off. So if your cost per result is $8, it might actually only be $4. Which is actually an insane difference. It could be the difference between profitable or not. So what a lot of people do is they use something called AEM to train on. And AEM is met as aggregated event management system. That basically it uses some IP tracking. It also connects to scan or something and lets you it lets you measure. It's an estimation. So it's not necessarily as accurate as scan. But it's for us we it's it's very very close to being correct. It's it's not like the 50% off usually. So it's closer to the actual number. Still usually an underestimate from my experience. And so and it's instantaneous. You don't have to wait three days to get data back. And therefore you can just start. You can the algorithm will learn much faster. So. You have some homework to do. I'm not going to show you how to set this up. So it's a lot to do. And honestly I don't think I was the one that set it up for Cali. But I would read those two articles look into these. I would set up both scan and AEM. There are tutorials online to set these up. Apps flyer honestly may have more tutorials online than adjust. So I would recommend looking at those apps as used by more people. We just haven't used adjust. And then in terms of AEM. That's also something. If you're paying for this course, you clearly have some money to invest. So. I would potentially look into consulting someone on fiber. There are attribution specialists on fiber. Fiber. Attribution. Specialist. Facebook ads. Let's see. Most of these look like scams and not going to lie. So these guys might be good. Facebook ads. Just. I'd say look he apps flyer. Damn, these are actually flyers. Yeah, like this guy apps flyer. Might have some adjust experience. So you can find people online trying to call Henry. I know we found someone online. I think it was on Upwork that we found our guy too. Hey, what's up? You know what's up? We saw the phone with Hussein. Just really quick. Really, really quick. The attribution specialist that we worked with. How did we find him? Was it Upwork? Yeah. Okay, say thanks. Peace. Yeah, see ya. So yeah, it's definitely worth paying for these guys because dude, attribution is a headache and you need it to be done right. You really do. If attribution is not set up, your campaign will not work. You'll be super unprofitable. There is a strategy to pretty much ensure profitability. So I think I kind of hinted at this before but. I get tutorial campaign. That's what we're working in. When you. When you upload an ad. There is something called a custom product page. And. This is actually something that. You can abuse a little bit. Apple. Let you create custom product pages for your app. This is fine show. And basically you can see exactly how much revenue was generated from the custom product page. So you click app, you click your app, you go to custom product pages. You can create a new one. So create one. And then once you have them, I mean, it should literally just be the same exact thing is you should name it something different. It's something unique. You have the link you copy it. And then you put the link right in where it says custom product page. But then once you have it, you could actually go to your analytics. And you could go to acquisition. You could go to product pages. And you could find your custom product page. So we have a deep link for our paid ads. And we could see in the last 30 days, we generated $92,000. And so this is like verifiable no bullshit. I get attribution as confusing as it can be. And as much of a headache custom product pages are the savior. We're at the end of the day. You can sleep. Knowing that your ads are profitable, even with all the noise. You're running influencer campaigns and paid ads at the same time. You might not know how profitable one or the other is. So custom product pages can really cure this cure the anxiety. Because you know, okay, you're not losing money at least. So that's great. That is what you should do. And you can make up to like 35 custom product pages. So you can just have a bunch of custom product pages for different ads. Like one for every single head if you wanted to. We just use one for winners and one for test ads, I believe. But yes, this is the attribution section completed. Attributions, one of the hardest things of paper click advertising. And so definitely recommend either reading up a lot yourself and just grinding it out. Because you know, it's doable or finding a specialist on upwork, save yourself some time. Cool. Let's get in the next section.

Okay, so I just wanted to touch briefly now on Apple search ads. Prior to this, everything we went through, that's pretty applicable to all major paper-click ad platforms. Google, Snapchat ads, Facebook, which includes Instagram and, well, meta, which includes Instagram and Facebook. And TikTok ads basically all run in a very similar way. It works campaign, ad set ads. And so, Apple search ads is very different. Apple search ads are ads in places like shown here. You can see, oops, okay, so you'd see ads that come up in the suggested area when you first go in the app store. When you look up a keyword, something will come up at the top. In today, you can see an ad. Also, at the bottom of other apps, you will see other recommended apps. So, when you look up, for example, Cal AI, at the top, there is an ad that comes up because people bid on our keywords. So, there's actually this app that's super knowing a clone app called CalDi-Ai that is bidding on the word Cal AI. Now, we bid on it too. We have it about 50 to 60% of the time. You is very hard to get it 100% of the time. If you want to be like someone reasonably, like, break even or anything. But yeah, it's like these things turn into bidding wars and dog fights over inventory very, very quickly. So, two websites that you'll really need for this is the Apple search ads. And they have an advanced mode. They also have a basic mode. I'm not going to go too in depth or really that in depth at all really into setting this up. I'd suggest if you want to just get off the ground running, maybe just do the basic mode, you can look into how to get more advanced yourself. But if you do actually want to run the strategy and start running up, a lot of downloads from Apple search ads, I would recommend the platform search ad optimization.com. Essentially, it helps with AI and all kinds of stuff to help you optimize your bids. We're actually on the website because we use them. I really like the founder. He's a cool guy. He spent a lot of time and care building out this platform. He's also always willing to help people on it. So, it's a small team, not the many people that use it right now. The platform is great. It helps you do keyword research and helps you with a lot of research insights, anything you need in order to basically figure out which keywords you should start bidding on. Basically, the whole strategy comes down to grouping keywords into different groups, grouping keywords, and then bidding on those keywords together. So, for example, here we are bidding, and this is unprofitable, and calorie trucker and calorie counter. We are the reason we are doing this, and spending 2.5K a day, I'm zoomed in right now, I'm ID guys. So, we are bidding on these two words, calorie counter and calorie trucker, unprofitably right now. We only have about a 50% of ROAS because we're trying to get higher on the ranks. When you look up calorie trucker or calorie counter. Honestly, I think we're bidding a little too high, I just sent the message to the guy on our team who runs this, and we're going to try to be more profitable on this. But you can see the green is the revenue, the blue is what we're spending. I'm making it a little more clear. It's three days a day because we have the three day free trial, but then you'll see we're losing money on this, a few hundred dollars a day. And we have our brand keywords, and this is the brand protection element we were talking about. Other people are bidding on the term Kaliai, and our impression here is only 50% of the time. So, the other 50, it's like these random clone apps that are just copying us. We're spending 2K a day on this. We could spend more and protect it more, get more than 50%. But honestly, I don't think like a long, long term, we're going to be hurt by these low quality clones bidding on us. And they're definitely not profitable, so it's not a big risk for us. But then there's discovery broad groups where I believe it actually goes out and finds keywords for you. And this is great because then you just give it a budget, it will find keywords and it will spend. And this whole thing, it has an AI optimizer. So, every three days, this will automatically change our budgets for everything to make sure that we are profitable, which is very cool. I heavily recommend this platform. I am just really quick. There's two features here on how to do it. I'm not going to do a full guide. But the two core things you need to know is scaling up or down the max cost per tap, the max you're willing to bid for someone to click on your app, and then also changing the price. And it's this, or not the price, but how much you're willing to spend per day. And it's this balance of daily budget versus the max cost per tap, that first of all gives you the impression share and the row-os that you want. If your max cost per tap is too low, then you actually will just not spend any of this. You could see if the budget's too low, you'll see right here, our max cost per tap is $1.11, and other people are bidding more than us. So we are barely spending. We said you're allowed to spend up to 2.2K, but it's only spending $462. Definitely look more into this if you're interested. It's a, I think Apple search ads are definitely worth the investment. Early on, I would be careful with, I showed a bunch of different distribution platforms through this, Conor showed some as well. I would pick one and go hard on it. If you try to do all of them at once, you're more likely to fail at each one individually. I think we're good here. I think we are anything else I'm missing, maybe not. Maybe, I mean, I know I didn't go that in depth in this, but I'm honestly not too much of an expert, otherwise that would have. It's just about finding the right keywords and then bidding. Okay, so you guys in the next section.

All right, let's get into some ASO, also known as Apple Search Optimization. I know personally, people that run studios where their apps, the only advertising they do, is Apple Search ads and Apple Search Optimization. And together, because they work together very closely, they are doing six figures a month. And it's extremely, extremely profitable, extremely profitable because ASO is pretty much completely profitable. And then Apple Search ads, that's the only money they're spending. But that's really profitable, too. So the power, this is not something you should sleep on. A lot of people sleep on it, but ASO, honestly, I look at it as a pre-do principle type of thing. The 80-20 rule, do 20% of work that will count for 80% of the results. How it works is everything you do in your apps title description, mostly title sub-title keywords, that will affect its rankings on the app store. It will affect it when you look up your app's name, is it number one, is it number two, is it number three? It will, if your app is in a specific category, like Cali as a calorie tracker, if you look up calorie tracker, we're the fourth one that comes up. And this all comes down to Apple Search Optimization. And you could keep refining this, and month after month, do all these little tweaks that will help you improve and go up on the rankings for these different keywords over time. And a lot of people do that. Like the studio I mentioned, they're obsessed with their rankings. And they're always adapting, always doing these little tweaks, changing keywords, all the stuff that I'll get into in order to rank higher. For me, I get it as something, when you set up the app once, do it, do it right, that will account for 80% of the results you'll get. And then just leave it, honestly, don't spend more time, focus on more scalable channels. So Apple Search Optimization, how does it work? Well, have you ever wondered why we named Cali-Ey calorie tracker? It's not because we want people to know that Cali-Ey is a calorie tracker. It's because the name is the most important part to Apple categorizing your app. If we put calorie tracker in subtitle instead of in the name, then we would drop a few places on App Store rankings when you look up calorie tracker right now. Your main keywords you want to include in your name. Essentially, how it goes is there's a hierarchy of importance. So a lot of people think that the keyword section, the keyword section on your app, and sorry to jump around them, I'll go back to this in a second. But a lot of people think the keywords for your app are, and I actually hit up whatever it can. A lot of people think the keywords for your app is very important for, I'm just saying, is it sensitive to show this because competitors may watch this and they see our keywords? Is that bad? I don't think they could do much with it. We'll see what happens. I think we're okay. Yes, I think most of these keywords are actually public. Whatever. So a lot of people see these keywords and they think, okay, keywords are the only thing that matters for App Store rankings. That's not true. Keywords are pretty important, but they're the third most important thing. First is your name, second is your subtitle, and last is your keywords. And what you essentially want to do is figure out a list of all the keywords that are closest to your niche, rank them, and then start putting them in to most relevant to your name, least relevant to the keywords. But it's not just about relevancy. It's also about how saturated each keyword is because some keywords have so many apps putting in CaliTrucker. For example, in the name, and so it's very difficult to rank. Whereas if we did something like, I don't know, food counter, in the name, it's less, less people are doing that. And so it would be easier for us to rank on the App Store charts. And by rank, I literally mean, I'll show you. I literally mean if you look up CaliTrucker. Look up CaliTrucker alone, scroll down, one, my fitness pal, two, some other app, three, lose it, and four, Cali AI. And that is driving us many downloads a day. I think probably like a few hundred, honestly, it's not that many. That's why this isn't so scalable. But those few hundred downloads are making us a few hundred dollars a day, completely profitable, completely profitable. I'll just because we set this up early on. So what you'll want to do when you're setting up your app is one, it would be sick if within your actual apps name, you are strategic and include some keywords that will help you. So for us putting AI and Cali, is actually fucking incredible because if we, if our app is called like, I don't know, Cali, like Cali Pro, and we wanted our app to come up when you look up AI CaliTrucker, we couldn't write Cali Pro dash CaliTrucker. We would have to write Cali Pro dash AI CaliTrucker. And I don't even think that fits. There's a limit of like 30 characters here. And so it's very important that all of the space is very utilized. You want to basically hit everything. I think the more keywords you fit, actually the less impactful each one will be. These are some things I've learned. So that's why we don't fit like another one. And here also just looks stupid. CaliTrucker fit. So there definitely is a balance when creating the name of your app between actually sounding cool, looking like a brand and then also packing keywords in. So okay, hierarchy. You want your top keyword up there with your name. So a lot of people do the name of their app dash their main keywords subtitle second best keywords food and macro counter. Like that's kind of related to CaliTrucker. It is what it is. It's a food and macro counter. But I think in the past we had like fitness, like counter on a tracker, all the stuff. But we realized those keywords actually weren't. They weren't as they didn't get as many searches. And by the way, all of this you can check in at twiek.com. It has some kind of so keywords. You can for different keywords, you like search them. I have to cost money. I think there's a free trial. But you can see the volume of how many people are searching it per month. So CaliTrucker 100 100,000 people search that every single month. The difficulty is 43. It's pretty high. A lot of people use it. And CaliTrucker is number four. Okay. It's estimating that CaliTrucker we get 2,700 downloads from CaliTrucker every single month and 4,640 from CaliTrucker. So we make about $3 in profit per download. So that is like almost 20K in just pure profit just because we have these terms. So great. We have our title subtitle. And by the way, you do not want to use the same keywords over and over. If you put, if I put CaliTrucker in subtitle, it will assume it will act as if it wasn't a name. It will act as if it was only in the subtitle. So it would lower the importance. So you only want to say a keyword and each word is used as a keyword. So how it works is within this, you might only think there's like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, different keyword pairs. There's just 7 different words. But how it actually works is it matches up all these words. So if you look up food CaliTrucker, that will, we will be in that ranking. If you look up macro CaliTrucker, we will be in that ranking. If you look up counter CaliTrucker, we'll be in that ranking. If you look up CaliAI macro counter, it essentially just like merges all the possible permutations of your keywords, placing preference to name, then subtitle and keywords. So you'll want to fit not necessarily as many as you can, but you'll want to keep it clean for the nice, brand aesthetic while putting your most important ones in the name and subtitle. You should not just try to fill it mostly. I feel like 10 spaces left over. We may actually want to add another one for CaliI. It seems like I'm missed opportunity. So then the last place is your keywords and here. It's very important. You don't want to put a space in between each one. You want to put a comma in between each word to be, because that's how you separate it. You separate it with commas. But a lot of people will do comma space and then that just loses you a character. So don't put spaces and you'll get more keywords. And then you just want to squeeze as many. And remember, do not repeat from the subtitle or the type. Just fit as many as you can. If you're looking for keywords, AppTweek is a great place to find some keywords to use. You can look at your competitors, see what keywords they use. And that's pretty helpful. Or you can just raw dog out of your head. If you're just trying to launch and get it out quick and sure, but I would go back, I would use some of these keyword tools. You could also use search out optimization, which I showed in one of the previous modules. And that has a keyword finder as well. So that's a very important step of ASO is the title, subtitle and keywords. Remember that the next important thing is the app icon and AppSource screenshots. What we just went through the title, subtitle keywords, this will help your app rank for these different keywords. This will help your app show up. Once someone actually looks it up, once someone looks up CaliTrocker, what will make them click on yours rather than someone else's? This primarily comes down to the icon and screenshots. So for us, our screenshots are honestly not the best in my opinion. The thing is, these are literally the screenshots that we started the app with. Or maybe like a month after launching we changed to these. However, we haven't been able to beat them for some reason. We've done all these iterations. I think it's partially a problem with Apple's AB testing software for AB testing screenshots. What you could do, by the way, in the product page optimization, which is all about app store optimization, you could run some tests where you AB tests are running screenshots. And we tried all this stuff, like putting AI CaliTrocker really big. Because essentially theories say you want like three words max really big at the top, then some visuals and like just big, catchy headlines for every screenshot. But for us, for some reason, our more raw screenshots that we built very early on have just been winning every single test. And we're still working on improving it. But I would keep in mind that I mean, even these like they're not bad screenshots. What you want is usually a visual of the app show clearly what it does. And try to make it short and snappy. Like this is too long in my opinion. It's working right now, but we're working on fixing the headlines. Make CaliTrocker easy with AI. Just have a picture of your food and let's do the rest. Only three screenshots are shown until someone clicks into your app. So the first, the were the most important. And ideally they can kind of tell a story together. Just have a picture. Then let us do the rest. Tell us a story. They need each other. They can't really stand alone. So that's important. You could actually see your app store, your conversion rate in the analytics page. And the conversion rate means how many people see your app and then we'll click on it. Leave the conversion rate. Yeah, so it's hours out of the people that see it about 21% will click into the page. Not necessarily download it, but just click into the page. Oh, okay, it actually downloads out of people that clicked into it. So my bad 21% of people like go to the Cali app page will download it. All of these numbers that we've actually had are very skewed. I've noticed because of influencer marketing, most people that run paid ads have like different numbers. They're like, wow, your numbers are either really, our numbers are either really bad or really good to these people. But it's just all skewed and a little different because we have influencers promoting it. And it's not paid ads going like directly to the page with maybe higher intent or lower intent sometimes. So the last thing that's important is the icon super, super important. So just up here. The icon and the screenshots both can have a significant effect on the conversion rate. This icon we used to just have the apple. We used to just have it. You can look in our. Okay, you see this. Metadata history. So our old logo was just the apple. And then we added the scan lines because we hypothesized, all right, if we add the scan lines, we'll tell the user that you're actually taking the picture. It's scanning something. It's not just an apple. You understand more of what the app may be doing. And that alone boosted the conversion rate 7%, which is huge. It's massive. So do not underestimate the power of your icons and screenshots in these small tweaks. You want to try to show what the app does in the most clean way possible. Okay. So this is very high level app store optimization breakdown of it. If you're interested in learning more, I actually attached. There are all kinds of great articles by app tweak on this topic. And if you go to their start as a section, they break down so much about best practices for screenshots, how to a B test app icon design keywords. And I would definitely recommend reading them. It's definitely worth it to get a deeper understanding. But with this, you should be able to start making money. This is, yeah, this is the app store optimization section. It's a quick one, not too much involved, not as complicated as the other ones. But it's very, very profitable. So with that, I'm out.

### Transcript

Hey everyone welcome back to the distribution module my name is Alex Slater and I'll be interjecting my input on how to be successful at Reddit and X marketing. We'll start with X just for now and like I love X because it's how we started and because there are a lot of theme pages that post a lot of times a day so like you can get very low CPMs and I think at the start we used to pay like 50 to 100 bucks per tweet and per thread. This is one of the first ones we've ever done. They said 237,000 views. We probably paid maybe like $100 maximum. I remember that being our maximum at the time and this is August 22nd so almost a year ago today will be first launched quitter. Now this is very intentional. Pawn is the worst drug for young men. Very clear hook, very scary outcome. The worst drug and the reason this does so well is not only is it not widely known and accepted yet that pawn is like damaging for people but also because it's very normalized because it's like people consume a lot. So when they hear all right I'm consuming this thing every day or every week whatever and now it's apparently being compared as the worst drug ever now you have my attention now I want to read the thread. So then it carries on it's kind of like a funnel it's like a week in a brain but and then you keep going down more more stuff more stuff it lowers yourself a steam and then in your head you're learning about how damaging pawn is and they're boom quitter push. Do you want to quit pawn but you keep failing? Why? Because you don't have the right tools that's about to change. I found an app that can help you quit pawn meet quitter and I think maybe this premise specifically would have made us $500 to $1000 but like in our first week of launch this is really good and that's a 10X ROI so I don't hate it and I'm going to show you some far better tweets very very shortly. What I would change about this though is like it's a very clear push and you can see like the drop off from light so it started at 500 now it's only at 16 but the views are what matters and you know even though the push is super super hard I think mine share is important and the more people that are aware that quitter is for quitting pawn there is apps and there are solutions out there for this kind of stuff the word will spread and you'll eventually get interaction. So yeah I love tweets and there are like way more examples of this so the psych wizard psych wizard is another account we partnered with this had 750,000 views I think for this spread I think we paid $300, $400 because I structured it like a bonus I'll be like all right bro I'll give you $100 base and then if you get this amount of views I'll give you an extra 200, 300, 400 and I just do remember getting an argument with this guy because he tried to charge us like $400, $500 and to meet the time that was like way too much money and Apple Payouts weren't hitting yet so like so yeah but I remember this doing very well for us I think this spread specifically made like two to two and a half thousand dollars and again look at the day a year ago today so one of them are most successful threads this at 2k likes and look instead of it saying porn is the worst drug for young men at the top it's also in the image and what I've noticed about the x algorithm is like images do the best like text is very easy to scroll past but images capture attention and they induce the most dopamine and that's how you can you know convert and have more viral tweets more often so yeah same kind of format porn will defeat your inner drive in self confidence but then as you could see we skip straight to the push straight to the push instead of it being like multiple threads down it's like hit straight away so this entire thread is like a marketing like marketing material there's nothing else and this kind of serves as like the prerequisite like okay pour with the feet self confidence oh make it weak you'll get sidetracked you will it will decrease your will power and people are like sitting here reading it mean like no I don't want this I want to be the strongest man I can be I want to be the richest I want to be the best looking and it's like okay if port like if if no one okay if the reader has not achieved these things or they feel weak or they feel sidetracked and they consume porn and we're telling you is the worst drug for young men that might be like a connection that people make and they're like okay maybe this is damaging me maybe this is holding back and when they see the quitter ad they're like okay I'll just give it a try so they click on the link and then they go to the app store and they're like oh 20,000 five star reviews and it looks fucking amazing I'm just gonna pay for it oh so I'm just gonna download it and then they end up paying and then everything we make from the tweet we can just reinvest into more and more threads and keep scaling so that's one version of the tweets very very simple format these kind of deep fried tweets go viral maybe like once every two three days so you won't be able to put out mascara that pissing people off well you could spread awareness doing that but like if you're looking for the intense ROI I would space them out maybe two or three maybe one week apart and yeah like the solid strategy really helped in the beginning you can totally rip this forward ever news and it maybe you're you had a calorie tracking app and it's like obesity is reducing birth rates this is why you need to track your calories whatever okay so now now onto some experimental tweets I saw a lot of news pages post like two pictures slideshows where it'd be like one company and then another company and then like a headline kind of like a new like a news headline but on Twitter obviously so I came up with this idea where maybe we could do the same for quitter and announce news because Twitter is kind of like where everyone gets like instant news and I would I would just make it a joke or a meme and it feels super serious because it's on Twitter but it's not so I was like okay what could be the most controversial and get people hyped up and get people being like holy shit this is sick like like for example I give you like a real quick example imagine it's like breaking news the US has shot five bombs towards Russia and there's USA flagging and it's Kim's jump and then it's Putin on the right people would blow that shit up especially if it came from like a respected news source that would go superviral so I decided to pick one of these theme pages that like post a bunch of memes all day so for example this guy had 135k followers but you can see he gets solid view views and likes like 132k likes and then obviously a bunch of them flock a bunch of them flock and then he has 1k likes and then 168k likes so yeah so I was like okay I'm gonna throw some shots at the dartboard and hopefully it goes well and I was like okay quitter buys only fans and shuts it down that was my vision quitter buys only fans and shuts it down and you know the first couple times I didn't go well as you can see this only got 1.6k likes and then we tried another account and it was like 1k likes and I was like oh this is solid but it's not like super viral and I was I just believed in myself I was like maybe we just have a few more attempts for a few more hundred dollar bills these guys and see what happens and then we launched this oh shit then we launched this I paid a hundred dollars I paid a hundred dollars for this for this tweet guess how much this made me probably close to a hundred thousand dollars from one tweet one tweet this got 11.4 million views 143,000 likes and an insane amount of traction in the comments so people like holy shit like no way this is happening and then look at the link 848,000 views yeah there's made us a lot of money and if it wasn't for my belief and if it wasn't for my understanding of the algorithm and to keep pushing and like obsessing over what's going viral and trying like frame that towards quitter and marketing this wouldn't have happened and you know what's really cool about this as well after I went viral on Twitter I was like okay they've probably go viral on Instagram and I just did the exact same format put it on Instagram that ripped as well another 200,000 likes 300,000 likes and probably a hundred million views total all platforms so it's very successful and you know I think a lot of people go into this app game and they think oh yeah short form let's pay for creators like push the app like 10 seconds into the video but there are so many other strategies that just people just overlook maybe because it isn't talked about enough but don't underestimate Twitter and I'm about to get to read it next but just don't underestimate these platforms and yeah peace out boys that's my segment
