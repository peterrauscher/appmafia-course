 Hey everyone, welcome back to the development module. Today we'll be going through cleanup and optimizations to the app we previously built, which is a Calais competitor. So I've gone out and done the courtesy of building and refining the app for you. The reason I did this off camera is because I feel like it's a better use of my time to just explain and show you how to do the higher revenue level pulling items rather than just copy pasting code that I've just taken from Quitter. So this is the new app. We have a splash screen, we now have a welcome view. The tutorial is relatively the same. I've just changed it a little bit of logic. But like all the code will be in the app Mafia document. You guys should be able to download this and you should be good to go. So skip quiz will bring us to a new page which asks your name. This is very important to make the app feel more personal and also your age. So this age is extremely important because we're going to be sending you to a different paywall or triggering a different paywall every like depending on your age group. And as I explained previously or maybe I explained it later on. Yeah, it might be a few lessons ahead in the super lesson. But pushing a user down a different paywall shows you the data on conversion rates for the demographic which helps you make better informed decisions when it comes to marketing because if you can see under 18s are converting like trash. You're not going to work with creators or run ads towards people that are under 18. Whereas like if you see that the demographic of 28 to 30 is doing extremely well the code to convert your rates extremely high. You'll be more it'll be more beneficial for you to put more eggs in that basket rather than under 18s. So collecting it here is very important. I've done all the logic for you but we will I will run through and explain how we'll set up different campaigns for different age groups. So yeah let's finish. I've also added a choose your goals thing. This just adds a little bit more friction a little bit more intentionality which helps conversion right at the end. We calculate I probably should add a few more slides and I probably will. You'll see in the get hub it might be slightly different. But again I'm going to explain you the high high revenue level pulling things we can do so you can make more money in your onboarding and we'll be building that out together. So now it's just complete you get a chart. This is very important rate the app. The more five stars it has in the app store the more trust you build. We also have this screen now which is welcome to Cali eye you're path to healthy eating based on your answers we've built a plan just for you. It's designed to help you lose 25 pounds in 90 days. So you're setting the target and expectation straight away. Now it's time to invest in yourself. Boom your custom plan is ready and this get get get started button should open the paywall but we haven't built the logic so let's build the logic. So first off when it says Alex your custom plan is ready I'm going to copy this stuff. Custom plan. So you should come pay will be right. Paywall. Paywall view okay we'll put this here and instead of saying Alex I'm just going to make it say backward bracket name. This should pull the name from whatever you put during the onboarding. So that's great user name actually. Okay so now instead of saying Alex will dynamically change based on what the user put in again this will all be in the get up code but let's build the logic for the let's get started button. Let's get started. This triggers view controller or press button and then the brackets. This links to a like this links to backend logic where it checks the user's age based on what it inputted during the onboarding and if it's you know below 22 it will put you in the 18 to 22 category. If it's below 28 or put you in the 23 to 28 category. If it's below 40 or put you in the 29 40 category and you can change this however you like if I want to have a broader age range I might go to 26 and then change or change this to 24 and change this to 26 and that will capture a smaller and more nuanced age range and of course like the that gives you better data on like which age range has the most revenue you can even thumb it down to like the actual age so instead of an age range we can just go 18 19 20 21 22 and maybe 22 has a 5% conversion rate over 21 and so it actually makes more sense to invest in 22 but we'll keep it how it was before I think it was completely fine. Now this is the most important part you see versus placement this is the event that you trip on super wall so if you're happy with these age ranges and we're going to do it for the sake of the tutorial we're just going to copy these placement names go into arc or whatever browser you're using go into the super wall go into campaigns and then start a new campaign we're going to call this under 18 we'll start under 18 and then top left by placements you click the plus the blue plus button you click select and you just paste in the name so under 18 add placement and then we'll go into paywalls add a paywall and then I guess we'll just do the example paywall for now and then set this to 100% of users I'm sure 100% removed is 100% from this one okay great now all we can do is we can just believe we just duplicate it right duplicate okay maybe not duplicate we might have to manually do it every single time which is totally fine you just go to new campaign again by the way this is the first one fully set up so now if I set my age is under 18 I will be traded with a paywall and we can test this right now as well let me just uninstall the app I had I have a backend check to see if they've reached the paywall and if they have reached the paywall then it needs to be the onboarding again which is great because if they skip all the questions they usually log back in if they're re-hide tent they're like okay I'm going to pay this time tap the button pay so you don't want to get into the onboarding again because they might just quit and you'll lose that on that revenue so I'll show you proof that this works now so if I set my name as it will change it will click barely my age is 17 so this is under 18 I should be able to see the paywall now right not now next okay that's also hey Alex but I don't think I changed that hey Alex hey Alex will paste in the name here same backward user name and we'll just pull that from the okay let's begin this should say hey Billy now okay yeah Billy your custom plan is ready all right we'll get back to this sorry about that okay so now I should be able to access the under 18 paywall because I set my age is 17 so there we go now it's triggered and this data will be transmuted back to the super-platform and it should if I wasn't on a simulator it should say one uses and if I were to pay it would say $20 and proceeds now this is great and I'll show you quitters break down right here I'm gonna go through this later in a different segment too but if you see quitters break down all the revenue for today is very clear under 18s has likely the most traffic but the least amount of proceeds okay you see that right here but the 23 to 28 range has the highest conversion rate and like the most revenue per user so it's very informative to do this and look we'll just set up the rest of the campaigns so you guys are aware how to do it go back to paywall logic and then 18 to 22 although you can call the campaign anything I usually just do this so 18 to 22 placements top left paste 18 to 22 and then add the same paywall as before or you can change the paywall and change the pricing this is very good when it comes to testing how to maximize revenue and again we go into this in a future segment so save that go back into new campaign this one's 23 to 28 and we'll just copy the placement age 23 to 28 very simple stuff at the paywall again by the way I feel like I'm the first to do this at least in the soup will break down a lot of people send the traffic to the set all the traffic to the same paywall and just hope for the best and I wish I would have done this sooner because ever since I found out that 23 to 28 age range converted the best all of our matter ads were shifted towards that age range we're now super super profitable so you guys are learning the fucking secrets right here right so 29 to 40 entries this is extremely large gap and maybe I recommend you know lowering this but this is what we're gonna do for now example paywall all right and then above 40 is the final one over 40 all right guys you are now fully set up and the app will change the paywall and change the direction of data depending on the age you put in on-boarding massive massive progress good shit so all right that's the first thing that helps you who's revving you that's the first step let's see what else we got we also have showed notification after five minutes okay this is a really fun one I love doing this anytime someone reaches the paywall and they don't convert and of course like the majority will not convert we'll just ping them with notification saying hey Alex whatever name they use during on-boarding like we like you made it so far that you're about to invest in yourself you're about to invest in your new life here's 80% off just in case you are on the edge of buying and you were like uncertain such change might last second this code will copy from quitter I believe 80% if I search that here we go yep so this notification right here so private func schedule notification again this will be in the GitHub code we will trigger this at the paywall so we'll send on appear the first let's build the funk so funk right here and then on-appear schedule notification okay we can remove this this is Firebase we don't need that and yeah so it's it goes username we didn't give up on you limited time offer get 80% off of cal AI and become the healthiest version of yourself and you can say we have an amazing community in 35 plus features this is kind of fluff probably don't need that but this will catch their attention and they will be like okay holy shit I've got to subscribe I was so close to being the best version myself and I've just been reminded I've just pushed this foot in the user's mind that this is the key I need cal AI and so that little notch really helps conversion rates and I can show you from my end what that looks like on the bottom line revenue side of things we call this discount button we show the boss in half the five minutes and it's right here of course the revenue is super low today but like you can just estimate so discount button has a 10% conversion rate and 500 users of the three and a half K view this screen so we make an extra thousand a day or like almost 20% extra a day just by this notification and this discount button on that note let's create the discount button it's right here discount you so we'll just copy the discount view again I'll provide this code in GitHub is a lot of copying pasting discount so it's boring because there's a lot of copy pasting but it's so worth it dot crackdown dot white okay cool looks good and then I'm sure we just put the discount code viewed this kind of code view inside the peal right discount view okay yeah great so we just copied this go into the paywall and put it underneath the main target discount view know what this does is as soon as you view the page it starts counting down from a five minute timer of the five minutes you get hit the notification and you also get hit with a discount button so very flawless logic that's great boost revenue by a thousand dollars a day for us so extra thirty K a month no complaining no complaining um let's also go to what else shortcuts so I love shortcuts um and I'll explain why any time you try and uninstall quitter there's two buttons there's one are you deleting like tell us why send your feedback like let's improve the app for you let's make this experience better and we learn a lot about how i use this feel about our product and continuously iterate and improve to the point where the conversion rate increases because we solve all the problems that people are having in the past now the main um requests we get is that we're too expensive and we shouldn't even monetize an addition etc etc um but having this button shows you care there is a second button but it could be because I've already paid that I don't see it but I could pull it up on my phone and we'll be building it out this is the this is the important button let's see okay I can just show you on my phone so the second button as you can see is try for free so this button once you click it and I'll click it right here we'll open the app and trigger the paywall trigger a paywall that gives you a free child to quitter now all of our apps cali i quitter you max etc are are hard payalled meaning that you can't access anything for free and it's just a funnel to convert you the reason we offer a free trial is because people holding on the app long pressing on the app are usually just going to delete it so as as our last ditch attempt we give them free trial and if they like the product then they stick around and we make revenue from it and I can show you the revenue from quitter's end for what we make in free trials as you can see right here we had 200 people that were about to uninstall but saw the free trial button and then clicked it and then from that we have 20 convergents so around a 10% convergent rate and today we've made 81 dollars now doesn't seem like a lot again there's also like time discrepancy on it which like we have to wait a week or three days I'm not sure but if I change this to the last 90 days we can see how much bottom line revenue is generated and it's done $12,000 in the last 90 days or people that were about to uninstall but ended up staying giving us a try and enjoying the product now of course these people are the most they are the lowest intent they didn't want to invest themselves at first you know they like hesitant stuff free trial and usually they probably have my money but like we still make thousands of dollars off of that small probability so at scale I do totally recommend it I think it's a great idea so let me show you how we built that all right so I've written gpt and I pretty much copied quitter's scene delegate where we trigger the update quick actions button so anytime the app is launched it displays these shortcuts I for instance judge it be to you and it gave us like this complete mess of code which again will be linked below I just pasted it in and it's seemingly working so if we hold down the cali app now there's a deleting tell us why button and a try for free button which is great now we just need to link this back to soup wall and get it fully set up so this quitter let's get back to cali i um all right so here item dot append quick actions so how do I do the action is it down here okay so this is the action so we're going to do soup wall dot shared dot uh what was it soup wall dot shared dot register I don't know why it's called registers where placement we'll pull this free underscore trial and that should be good to go okay great um and then for this one you can do a link to a google form it's very simple how to do that online I can show you how we do it for quitter um okay so this is how we do it for quitter when the actions performed we do open url the code to open url is right here just copy this line and we'll bring it over to cali i as well paste this at the top wait maybe like this okay that works and then when it comes to oh actually it should be like here and then when it comes to sending feedback what you got to do is do open and open url and then link the url so where it should be i believe it's like url on the score value let me pull the exact thing we do open url so yeah this is the code used to url I guess we just paste this at the top as well and then put in your google form so this is the one we used to collect feedback for quitter you can make a google form and put in whatever link you need to here as well um and then just do open url website url and the quick and then the annual plan quick action should register the free trial which will set up and super right now so we'll set up a let's go to cali i and we'll just go to templates oh this one I could free trial ish template something like this i actually like this is better so we use this template we'll pull it free trial free trial you will never see this again etc etc we don't need to add a product you guys can add a product off to the fact um and then we'll create a brand new campaign we'll call this one free underscore trial and we'll also call the placement free underscore trial and then we'll add the brand new free trial paywall so that is the top create changes to a 100% changes to 0% save save relaunch the app so we use command or build succeeded good shit good shit and then if you hold down on the cali app just as you're about to delete it you're from to with two things one you delete and tell us why and this will open the website and the trial for free oh it's not fucking working are you serious right it's not working but we'll fix this right now all right you know what boys i will just add the code to the get hub that works charge evt is having issues right now um but yeah just down at the get hub code everything's linked just make sure you follow the super tutorial on how to set up the campaigns and you should be all good out the box peace out
