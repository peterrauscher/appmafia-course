 Alright boys, we're back, minimal cuts, let's get straight back into business. So in this module we'll be going through onboarding and onboarding logic. This is the lead up to getting someone to pay for your subscription. And in my opinion, this is the most important step for consumer apps that are utility and subscription based. For social apps you want to reduce and as opposed to dating, oh well not dating apps, but social apps for sure, you want to reduce the amount of friction because every screen like reduces the amount of people that will convert to the end. And like if I pull up my logic, sorry, my mix panel, my data and we will get more into this later. But you can see this is my onboarding funnel and yeah, you can see there is drop off. Like only 95% of people converted to the fifth screen from the third screen, from the fourth screen. So usually in most cases you don't want to add this friction but when it comes to trying to prep someone to pay, the more time they spend doing the onboarding answering questions and finding out more about the product, the more likely they are to pay. Whereas like if it was a one or two screen, then you hit with a paywall, it's super easy to close the app, uninstall and just not end up paying. So the friction is incredibly necessary. Also wow, that's a massive drop off. Oh, I know where that is. No worries, it's not actually about how it's just been for the last very days. I introduced a new page, so all the previous guys didn't see it. That's fine. Okay, back to it. So how do we build this from a technical point of view? Now we want a list of questions and answers and we want the flow for the screen to move on to the next question after you answer the previous question and then at the end of it there should be the paywall trigger and then the paywall trigger after you pay you should enter the app. So let's dive straight into the logic. What I'm going to do is make a new file. I'm going to do command N and I'm going to click switch like you. I'm going to call this onboarding view. Okay, so now I'm going to copy this file. Actually what I'm going to do is start and I'm going to open the preview so you guys can see, make it very clear. So hello world. Now I'm going to go back into chat to BT and I'm going to context with, is that the weren't we? Context or communicate or whatever with chat to BT and try and build this funnel. So hi chat to BT, I'm building an onboarding funnel that asks the user questions about their calorie tracking process and goals. Please make every question somewhat different and build a nurture a relationship so they can convert pay at the end of the funnel. Once all screens are answered, display a loading screen, a calculating loading screen and then trigger if empty font that I will build into later. Okay, then I'm going to send it my code. This is kind of prompt I would ask again, it's not probably the most optimal and bleak probably has better prompts but I want to be raw and transparent on how I do it and a little bit about me. I have a successful app. I own Quitzer. We do half a million dollars a month. I coded a lot of it myself. So I know what I'm doing for the most part and even if it seems like I don't know what I'm doing, well look how far it got me so I'm going to share it anyway. Okay, well that was a very quick one. Let's sip some water but I guess not. This is great. I can already tell. This is great. This first question is asked. Maybe later. You don't want to ever give the option to do it later. That sucks. We'll change it to a different question. Progress bar. Okay, progress bar at the top. Question view. This is great. The functions. So this function just like pushes you to the next step to the next question. It just adds an animation. Kinders. Again, it's doing it all in one file which I think for the tutorial was really simple. Long term you want to switch to the MVVM structure which is model view model and they had three separate files. But again, this isn't like a technical masterclass. This is how to build an app from scratch and how to build something that's been successful in the past. And then just as soon as you built it, just go out there and do some marketing because you can market and make money from almost anything. Although of course, make sure you're putting up good quality stuff. I don't suggest you just putting up sloth and trying to make money. I suggest you try and help people or help the niche. And that is like the key to being successful. Okay, so we're just going to copy and paste this in. Hopefully this works. First try, baby. Okay, welcome to Kaliai. I'll tailor you to this. Sounds good. Let's do it. Continue. Bro, this is amazing. This is great. Let me see if you click this. Okay, it doesn't matter. Let's do it. I'm just going to change this to. I can't wait. Let's go. Just for simplicity. Obviously I won't actually put this. I can't wait. Let's go. All right. So the whole point of this, oh, should I be going to load? Bra. Wow. That is crazy long. I'm just going to run this myself. My bad. Okay. So as I was saying, the whole point on boarding is to like answer the user's questions because you need to convince them on why paying for Kaliai is a good idea before they get hit the screen and then they're like, should I, if I can pay or should I leave? So you're supposed to answer all of his questions beforehand and convince them. So when they do get hit with the pay, they're like, huh, but actually I answered a bunch of questions and I believe in this and I really want to get started. I'm super motivated. Boom impulse by unsubscribeer. Let me use this product. So we'll go through this. Boom. Where are you starting from? Tiddle beginner. Which primary goal? These fact. I just like multiple. Okay. Now, primary goal. Okay. Cool. What's your target pace? Boom. Simple. How do you want to track photo estimate? This is great. How many workouts a week? This is a bit of a random question. But hey, when you can input stuff, I love pizza, but I know I shouldn't. Boom. Finish. Calculate in your plan. This is the key. You need to have the app think about the answers and results because that makes it look more legit. That is the key. That is the key. Okay. And at this point, after it's calculated, the plan should pump the paywall, which goes on to our next topic, which is super. So let's get into super wall and we will show you how to make money from your product.
