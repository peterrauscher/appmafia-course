 Welcome to the distribution section of the course. I'm Zach. I'll be leading you through the beginning part and then Connor will take over halfway through. We'll actually be switching off. He's gonna, yeah, what you'll see. But this is, if not the most important, one of, it's up there, like top one or two, the most important things of this entire course. You could have the best app in the world, the best ever. If you have zero distribution, you will get zero downloads and you will get zero sales, zero dollars in revenue. And we're not here just to build good apps. We're here to make money. So let's dive in and see how we're gonna do that. So the main distribution channels are really influencers doing influencer marketing, creating organic content. So this is posting on TikTok, Instagram, X, Reddit, anything that's organic. You're not paying for the posters, putting it up, letting the algorithm decide if it's gonna go viral. Paper click ads. This is Facebook ads, Google ads, Snapchat ads, meta ads. Meta actually includes Facebook and Instagram. And then a bunch of others. Then we have App Store Optimization. And this is if you guys are familiar with web apps, web development, the concept of SEO, search engine optimization. This is App Store Optimization or App Store ASO. App Store Optimization, yeah. Okay, App Store search that's incorrect. I'm gonna fix that. But it's App Store Optimization. And this is like keywords. So if you look for my app, Cali, the calorie tracking out, if you look up calorie tracker, the fourth search term will come up as Cali. So that's Apple search optimization or sorry, App Store Optimization. So everything is a trade off. If we look at the profitability curve, paper click ads are the least profitable influencers are the second least profitable. This is all generally, by the way, you might find that for you, it's totally different. But generally, this is what you'll find. Organic content is the second most profitable. And App Store Optimization is the most profitable. And this is really because App Store Optimization, it's just, it takes setup in the beginning when you first launch your app, you're just putting in the keywords, a bunch of things with the title and screenshots. And then it just goes, you're not spending money on this. If someone looks up your search term and goes to your app, you make money, you don't pay for anything. So it's the most profitable. Paper click ads, that's like you're directly paying one of these algorithms to find you a customer that's gonna go by your app. So you're paying to the least margin. Usually it's the greatest customer acquisition cost. Okay, now you go through the scalability curve. And you'll notice there's an inverse relationship between these two where the most profitable is the least scalable here and the least profitable is the most scalable Apple search optimization. App Store Optimization, fuck dude, least scalable, organic content, second least scalable, influencers, second most scalable and paper click ads, the most scalable. This is also everything here. Keep in mind is in general, you might find that it's similar for you. And by scalability, I mean, how hard it is to exhaust the channel, how many daily downloads or monthly downloads, can you pull from these channels? You'll be able to pull the most monthly downloads from paper click ads and the least from App Store Optimization generally. And it's at its peak performance. Okay, now there is the difficulty to start curve. Asso is by far the easiest to start. When you set up your app, you just have to keep a few principles in mind when you're designing your icon, your screenshots, your title, your subtitle and your keywords. So we're going to go through all of those, but really easy. And once you set it up, it's just good forever pretty much. Some people like to go in and change things, but we'll get to all of that. Organic content that it's a pretty steep pickup after App Store Optimization, then it goes to organic content where this, it's not that difficult to start. It's like you create a new account, you have to do something called warming up an account, which is a little bit annoying, but then you can just start posting. We'll get to that influencers. This is pretty difficult to start you have to DM hundreds of influencers. You're lucky if one replies, then you're lucky you can negotiate a deal with them, get them to post. All of these things will get into and paper click ads also very difficult to start. I was actually in between with influencers and paper click, which is the most difficult to start. Because they both have their difficulties and parts that are easier about them. So I'd say they're pretty similar. However, the reason I say paper click is more difficult is because it's generally more saturated. And so maybe like first of all, it requires a ton of setup, but even once you get started, it's not just about getting started in order to run it successfully the right way, be profitable. That's going to be so much more difficult than influencers usually, at least right off the bat. And it's a lot more setup than anything else for sure. The consistency curve. So this is like, can you rely on this channel to basically pulling the same number of downloads on a week over week, month over month, day over day basis. So organic content, this is the most sporadic. So all about the algorithm. People usually will post like 10 videos and they'll apply the pre-do principle, two of those will go viral and justify either the cost or time spent on those other eight videos that did not go viral. So that's organic content. So like, you don't know when a video is going to go viral. It's like randomly, you'll have these spikes. And maybe they normalize over a long period of time influencers influencers are definitely more steady because you can predict and we're going to get into how to do this, how many views your video will get. And so you can align things where you're basically pulling the same number of views per day and assuming your content is a similar quality, you'll get around the same number of downloads per day. Paper click ads are the second most consistent where the algorithm is really the it will it is it is complex and we'll get into all the complexities. However, generally, once you have it all set up once you have your ad creatives the videos, the videos that you're running as ads all set up and you set up your ad budgets. The algorithm will spend that amount every single day and until you exhaust your creatives, you'll see the same performance and exhausting creatives is something I'll explain later. And then we have apps or optimization and this is just pretty steady, like not that many people will search your keywords, not that many people will search for your app, but it will be pretty consistent over, you know, over the week or month, time period. Attribution tradeoffs used to be a bigger deal. So I was thinking of making another one of these curves, but I decided not to because in the past, one of the big one of the big reasons to run paid ads over something like influencer marketing is because of the attribution you could figure out exactly where the downloads came from. You know exactly how many downloads came from one ad with influencers think about it. They just posted video and there's no links on a tick talk. So the person that sees the videos to go download your app from the app source separately. And you don't know where they came from. You know, they may have came from the video because they were posted at the video is posted around the same time the download was in, but you can't get much better attribution than that. Especially if you have multiple posts going out at the same time because you're operating at such a large scale. So paid ads were better for so long because you could have hundreds of different ads running and each one would track how many downloads came from it specifically down to down to the device ID. But now because of all of Apple's regulations, you can do that anymore. And so attribution is very tricky. Therefore, it's almost just as hard as attributing influencer marketing at this point. Cool.
