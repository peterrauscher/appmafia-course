 GMGM. Alright, let's get after it. Grab your stimulants, grab your fucking coffee, grab your red bowl, your zins, your Lucy's, your SIGs, whatever it holds your boat, notes, fucking notepad and a pen, and let's get the fuck after it. Alright, here's the deal. We're going to be going over organic content. So the two main types of organic content are faceless and UGC. Faceless think of anything that you can rip and run with an editor, and UGC think of anything that is using an actual human to film themselves, film a hook, and then demo the app of some sort, maybe film a skit. So, diving into this, we will go through Riz, Riz GPT, if you guys know, Mr. Blake Anderson. They basically perfected, I would say, this format of, I'm positive or quickly, they basically perfected this format of Minecraft Park Core slash Dope of Mean hitting videos in the background with a text chat to show a guy having Riz. And so, let's watch this. Okay, you guys get the point. Another one would be, here we go. So keep in mind, this has almost 350,000 likes, it has a direct plug in the caption of the video. And with that said, another one that they do is the AI Bible chat. So, this is where you can see these rip a range of views from like almost 250,000 views, 230,000 views, but it's stories about the Bible. Using AI, obviously, which is something that I highly recommend a lot of you guys get into and learn is how can you leverage AI to your advantage in this game? Another one is for Quitter. This one's pretty funny. We have this account called the Goom Police because we realize that all of these only fan models are just ripping views, just being trashy online as the word I guess we'll use. And so, we have this Goom Police model. So, the whole point with this account is we built a our own basically theme page, right? From Info to the other theme pages around our own faceless format. And so we combine the two and create the Goom Police for Quitter. And we grew this like 10,000 followers in like less than two three weeks. So, that's another way you can do it. Full transparency. Like I said, we just have editors that we thought of this idea and told them what to do. They start cooking it up and we just mass-post. Another one is styles like this, which we posted on our actual Quitter account. No audio, funny enough. And it's simply just rage bait. Right? So, like this literally rage baits, comments like no other because it's literally saying everyone's a gooner except August and July. So, and gooning is obviously a hot topic. We want to talk about it. There you go. Another one is UGC. So, UGC like I said, is just own filming. So, just a pretense. This is for the App Haven, which is a Bible app. And this is what you did. It's a two-minute video. I don't think we need to watch this together. So, here. So, I don't obviously recommend doing it. Obviously, a minute 30 in, but I'm assuming that she also, yeah, I'm retarded. See, she's an influencer. That's on me. But the point is, is that you can rip and run styles like that for organic. Here's another one. So, this one is crazy case study. So, raise our boy sub, launch this, ripped it. I just got taken off the App Store, but they did very well with organic. And so, what they did is they had these girls filmed these before and after pictures. They filmed themselves with hooks, for example, like how to get 10 if you never get 10, showed the app. And this, I think video got millions of views. Yeah, 4.5 million. Another one is here. So, this is a turbo-learn organic content creator. So, turbo-learn is obviously an edtech platform to help you to, I know it's really study. This got 2.5 million likes. This account is organic. So, you'll see a lot of times, a lot of software's and apps will have one creator, usually like a college student or someone recently graduated looking to make money outside of school. Just rip styles. So, this girl is actually ripping styles. Like that style we just watched. She ripped that, what, 10, 15 more times. But, she only went viral on that one video we saw, which was where it was at 10.4 million views. And all the other ones got low views, except this one got 250,000 views. That's usually the game here. You want multiple creators posting multiple times to hit the algorithm and go viral. Last one is, so this is a skit style you'll see. And so, what this does is put the user in the famer reference that they're a student and they just got like in trouble from school. Now, you guys should know these are all staged, but the viewer on TikTok who watches does not know that. So, this was on one of their accounts last year, but that is, I would say, faceless and UGC in a nutshell. You should have a really good idea of what is faceless content, what is UGC? In faceless, you could also see things like carousel posts, UGC could also see different content. Some people do post like founder-led content, but when it comes to content like that, we are not going to dive into that because we think the highest levels that you can do are leveraging faceless and leveraging UGC to take over the algorithm, take over social media and push your app to the masses.
