 All right, all right, I think, wait, test, test. Yeah, okay. I think that I've got it working. What I'm gonna do here is I turn off the screen record audio. So you guys are just gonna listen to it through my mic. All right, let's get going. I wonder if it didn't eat damage, but it's hard to tell because it's just like who I ended up being, so like you don't really know if there's damage. I always think about that as well. I feel like smoking a lot of Zaza, and honestly makes you smarter over the long term. Because you always come to some crossroads. I think you made a video while back, talking about like when you quit for a little bit, that period when you stopped, you probably like had some sort of enlightenment. When you quit, you get like a new high. You haven't been sober and so on and it feels like you're higher. And that's why I started using the quitting weed app. So that would be an example of a place where content about smoking too much weed is very popular. And so I'm sure that they're quitting weed apps that already exist, but like anytime I watch a piece of content like that, I'm like, what's the hook at the very end? Where you plug it in some piece of software. Callin' actually very cool, and then Daddy well in this guy interviewing him. I'm going on his podcast in a few days. All right, let's keep going and take a look at this. Oh. Oh. You know, there you could probably like, when I look at that, I'm like, I'm thinking like, okay, in the bio. So this is from a creator who like he probably sells his own course or whatever, but this sort of content often does well. I'm like, okay, in the bio there, you could have some sort of call to action of like, so I know Sebastian George who runs this, this can, I guess somewhat consumer, somewhat B2B app, where you can create automatic Shopify templates, right? This is promoting e-commerce. You have in the caption, like go download or integrate this Chrome extension or whatever sort of form factor that app takes. You could easily integrate that right here. Summer 25 batch. Yeah. Hackney pimples dry skin red spots. We've all dealt with some version of it. And most of the topologists are going to give you a topical fix. Well, it does help treat the issue. It doesn't actually solve it. Trust me, I know with all my skincare videos. And reality, the core problem lies in your diet. And that's why I'm watching the new software called, I'm going to do a lot of work on it. I'm going to do a lot of work on it. And that's why I'm watching the new software called Be Clear. Right now, we're in formula testing. And I wonder if before I walk it in, do you guys prefer a powder where you can mix a drink or a daily pill? And would you want to just target breakouts or also focus on dryness, retinus and overall glow? I can always include skin supporting at the auctions, like vitamin C, zinc for healing them. So this is part of the looks, maxing niche, talking about skincare. I think there's actually an app that's been doing pretty well recently called Proofit where you can scan supplements and see how high quality they are. And so this is obviously, this is from KShami, a Senn Laboratories, his new brand doing supplements. But here I would probably, like this content obviously does well and traditionally has been doing well for a while, which content in the looks, maxing niche, get better skin, whatever. So something in the range of like, maybe a cross between like a Calai X sort of Proofit slash Yuka supplement, or excuse me, Yuka food scanner, where you have an application where you take a picture of food specifically designed for people with bad skin, or even like looks, maxing, right? Where you scan supplements, scan the food that you're eating and then get exercise recommendations to help you become more attractive. Let's keep going. So trading apps are becoming somewhat popular, sort of like chart analysis and whatnot. So any sort of account, anytime I see an account like this, if you're looking for an idea, you can find the sort of niche, which is like trading slash fintech advice and then work backwards. And you're like, okay, what are the problems that these people face? So you could pretty easily be like, so you could pretty easily build a product that provides like history and context on different coins, stocks, whatever it may be before you trade and actually purchase. Now I don't know whether or not you would need to offer trading for that product to work as well, but just an idea. As you can see my contents very, very much so like, you know, bro, fitness, entrepreneur, you know, as you earn money by rating AI responses, and it's all thanks to a tool that gives you free access to the 500 of the world's best AI models that actually pays you to use them. It's called a Yop AI, and let's you compare results from all like ChatGPT and Claude and Gemini, all in one place. You just give it a prompt and when you compare and rate the different AI responses, you get credits that can be written for actual real cash. And so not only is it completely free, but you also get used to on damn models like Brock and Gemini at the same time. Well, earning up to 50 bucks a month just for getting your feedback. Wanna try it for yourself? Just comment the up and I'll say to you. This is interesting. I mean, another example of a very quickly rising industry to build around. We go back to this sort of like course case studies success. Like AI, from what I've seen, the AI tools that do best are, or rather I should say they like learn to use AI style tools that do best are ones that are in the mix of sort of career progression slash education. Now this one, this guy is a great example of a creator that you can kind of build around. So I think that that's pretty interesting. Let's see that. This is the best fucking time ever starting company. But part of the reason that's the best is because the ground is shaking and it's true. There are a lot. All right, this messaging, another good framework here, finding messaging that is becoming increasingly popular on social media and then work backwards from there to like what's the idea that you build around it. Or what's the product that you build around that. So this was one of my plans with 10x. Unfortunately, I just don't think 10x had the correct product UX, as well as there were other sort of a few extraneous variables that made that company hard to scale. But you can see that anything about sort of like AI tools gets people up in arms. This person commented, misused AI skills are dangerous for humanity. This person is talking about, he's talking about how the AI tools are good for himself. Don't worry, there's nothing left for us to do. So fear mongering within the AI niche, like AI is going to take your job, figure out how to build a tool to prevent that from happening. Or to help the person take other people's jobs, as Ethan, right? That's like these N8N agents, which are like create these workflow automations to kind of outsource and displace traditional human labor. Okay, I've got an idea actually. I think I've mentioned this idea in the past. Nobody has really executed on it. Gotta blur that, you guys can't see what I'm looking at. Okay, this guy has been ripping recently. A good sign that a creator is doing really well, as well as they are operating within an up and coming space, becoming increasingly popular, is when they have, and they generate a lot of views relative to their followers. 60,000 followers on Instagram, doing a couple hundred thousand views of video is extremely impressive. Now, this guy and Draugianic, I think that's it, Andrew Genic. One of those two. He talks about steroids. Okay, so let's watch one of these videos. I can't volume. What the fuck? Let me make this a little bit smaller real quick so I can turn on volume. Tagging the stick, play on repeat. This term is used to disrupt a gene that is advantageous here, and the left is disadvantageous in lay life. All vice versa. How this relates to being natural or enhanced is that most gene variants, early provided vantage, either early or late in life, or not both. For example, longevity genes, such as the Fox 3, so one, overdue. Okay. I'm not gonna spend too much time watching this, but I'll give you guys the background on this rising industry. It's funny, I somewhat experienced this myself in seeing it firsthand in high school about half of my friends took steroids. Now, what are the big macro factors at play here? Melta Stoshrone is rapidly decreasing or has been rapidly decreasing over the past century, due to things like microplastics, low food quality, contaminated water, amongst other things. Now, a high proportion of people are pushing back against this by taking steroids. Another sort of tailwind here is people more than ever want to be and feel, I should say, has more than ever want to be and do feel masculine. So how do we build a product around this? Well, one, there's a lot of opportunity, I think, for building a product that helps people take steroids and provides advice to help them do it more safely. I personally don't want to be on the end of pushing and making steroids more accessible. I would not encourage that individuals build that, but there is opportunity there. Now, I see one of these niches. This is kind of what I did with the looks, Maxing. I'm like, okay, this is the tailwind. How do we build a product around this that pushes people in a positive direction? So I think that there's massive opportunity to build a product that helps people naturally maximize their testosterone. You have them input what they are currently doing, exercise, nutrition, sleep, whatever it may be. And then you develop a custom routine as well as habit tracking for them, do help them increase their testosterone. I would do this somewhat in the range of like UMAX, slash these daily habit trackers, slash like maybe like the inverse of quitter where you have like, it's all about your sort of like streak where quitter is all about like staying away from pouring, this could be all about, I guess this is just what habit trackers are, but keeping your streak of engaging in these testosterone optimization practices. Now even beyond that, I think there's a lot of opportunity to build a holistic health optimizer. So as you can see, like when I go through reels, it's not overly structured. I'm just going through using this to get my creative juices flowing. And even like with that guy Androgynick, I had seen that he was garnering a really cult, like, or I shouldn't say massive, but a very strong cult, like following on social media. And then I kind of start to work backwards, right? You identify the things that people are interested in and then you can kind of work backwards and figure out, okay, what they're interested in this because they have this subset of problems. Now how can I solve that inside of consumer application? All right, that's be good for Instagram. Let's move on over to TikTok. That as soon as the bar slows down, one or two minutes later, it falls on. Yeah, it was surprising. I'll be like, look, it's the easiest way to work. And the moment I struggle is that because you have a high proportion of fast, which mostly fibers only average person is why you could be a leader of the NFL. It means that your fibers create a fit. All right, this is TNF head of, I say head, essentially the leader of hypertrophy maximization TikTok. Building more muscle, right? He is the key opinion leader, very intelligent guy. If you go back to, I think it was my, I don't know, I was fucking one of these earlier lessons. I spoke about the idea that I had and started to build about a workout optimization application. I think that there is massive opportunity there. Nobody's got it right. If you deeply understand weightlifting and hypertrophy maximization, and you can actually develop, and you also have to have relatively extensive ML knowledge here, you can build an extremely effective recommendation product. Chat GPT will absolutely not suffice, but AI models could help with the data labeling side of things, which is non-trivial for something like this. By the way, by data labeling, I'm referring to, essentially like the values that you assign to the different variables that correspond to each individual lift. So for bench, I might assign 1.0 hypertrophic stimulus to my chest and maybe 0.5 to my front delts and 0.5 to my triceps, and then the overall fatigue load out of 10 might be an eight. All right, maybe seven. Whereas squat, right? It's going to be largely quads, glutes, and some hamstrings, and then fatigue load might be nine or 10. And then tricep extension, tricep stimulus would be a 1.0, and then one out of one, and then the fatigue stimulus would be somewhere in the range of like a four, three, whatever. So, okay, onward. Now based off of the sheer amount of people we're talking to, watch it. Another killer idea, Nick Fuentes, absolutely fucking ripping right now, he's taking over, I mean, honestly, like short form, like political right content, whatever. On the flip side, you've got guys like, like, Dean withers maybe, Harry fucking something, Sisson. I don't know anyone that's built a popular single player, AI politics app, massive opportunity there, right? I briefly built a software that I never, I just built like the back end skeleton where I scraped the RSS feeds of all the popular news websites, and I would generate unbiased reports based on the most controversial popular stories. Now you can build an AI app that does something like that, feeds people, you know, you'd have to do it in a legal way. I don't think that was actually, it would not have been legal if I commercialized that. So, do your own legal research. But then maybe you have that, and you have like a different personality, political test, that sort of thing. And then the amount of people who told me, oh, hi there, why didn't Jared help? And I'm the guy, everything, I've got knowledge. I'm not a lot of us. I don't, yeah, I don't really know what's going on here. I don't know why there are women on my 4U page. There's my therapist help me, Raleigh. I think it's more nature than people would like to, no matter how rich I get, there's one thing I will, share with Jimmy, that's my boy. There's just basically a super-digit trick. There's individual of us, Dad. I don't think that's a big deal. Alex, you bang, we love Alex, Alex is a Callie-I influencer. I like you go every Sunday. Okay, so you're like, oh man, get that bill and some. I don't know why there's all this Nick Fuentes on my 4U page. I love Jewish people. If anyone is gonna get mad about that, I do think Nick is an interesting guy, and I like listening to him. Nah, I touched that. Damn. Honey, why don't we just go get some funnel cakes? No funnel cakes, bear. Nah, I touched that cake. What are these little things? You don't have to be the dad got a job with it. It's not the shower, it's not the shower, it's not the party shower, it's not. Yes, you are. Look at the big guy. You're out in the fire. Hey guys, this is really easy. Where's he coming from? Here's where, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's good enough. This ceiling's gone. Diabolical things, I wanted a man. Number one, height. My man's gotta be above 62. My last two boyfriends were 63. Both of them. And they were jacked, and they looked really good. How am I supposed to downgrade from that? So unfortunately, my next man will have to be 62. And now, number two, you can't have a bet. I need you build. All right. All right. You ready? Number two, I need you to be fit. Boba, Boba, Boba, Boba. Number three. Number three, he needs to be emotionally intelligent. My friend literally just sent me this app where you can actually do like emotional intelligence tests with your boyfriend without them even realizing that it's an emotional intelligence test. And then then then then. But you see, that's a good fucking hook. Find the content, figure out how to build the product around it. This shit always rips. Girls just fucking. Man, man, man, man, man. I love girls. They'll get me wrong. But find girl content. Man, man, man, man, man. And then insert the product in number three. I'm sure they'll speak about this in distribution. But there are like hard strong hooks where you want to hit first couple seconds of the video. And then there are more natural hooks where you draw the person in. And they don't even realize what's going on. It's a fish. You cast the line. Fucking fish gets the worm. He's like, oh shit. I'm chillin. I'm eating good. And he starts pulling me. He's like, wait, what's going on here? It doesn't really know what the fuck's up. And then you fucking hook him. You know, right? That's what you do in these videos. You get him going. And then you integrate the promo. So that's one style. Did you fit and go into the gym multiple times a week? I'm sorry. I'm just not going to need a factor. If I have a salary cap to make corporate, what is your 100K salary for no we're good? I need you in a career that is. I'm just still watching this because I want to see if there's a plug. I am a lover of luxury. I like expensive things. I like expensive vacation. So you, if you're my man, so we need a career that can support that. Number four, whenever we travel, he's got to be fine as business. The other, I get salary. She's not really impressed when I hear something really big or a protectant. I get it. There's no product on there. I don't know why they're girls shaking ass on my 4U page. We don't watch that. We're bad that we can't reach $22,000. Oh. Welcome to the world. Yes, I, I, if the real reason for the current state of black communities is stop buying corn. I don't know. Do you think you look older than 19? Yes. Yeah, anything testosterone. This is clavicular friends with the guy that I mentioned earlier, and Draganic, and Santa Cruz medicinal. Santa Cruz and I used to be friends. He's mad at me now, because I think that he thinks I was talking shit. I wasn't, but you know, it's all right. Anyways, clavicular is also part of the whole Androganic like a teenage testosterone optimization movement. Once again, I'm not a fan of, or he does steroids, specifically, and pushes steroids to teenagers. I don't fuck with pushing steroids to people, but what I do fuck with is helping people get healthier. So he would be another good guy to consume his content if you want to understand this sort of like new wave. You know, this, it's almost like an offshoot of looks maxing into hormone optimization. Don't know if you'll play role-native. Don't stop, yeah, get it. Shake, shake, shake. I got slushing about that. This is a fire fucking ad. I got slushed into vicar. It's a shame. I really do. You're basketball. From the moment I started rolling my dick. Yo, there they are together. The two guys that I mentioned, Avicular and Androganic. That's hilarious. There are my single day, you're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. You're just flying. If you are thinking of working with that fine. Zinn. And. I distracted apparently the Ironman World Championship is 33 days away. Endurance training application. In my understanding, most of these apps are like individual right now or fragmented. So you got like a Strava obviously for planning your runs. Whereas, you know, Runa helps you with run training plans. I'm uncertain of the state of this, but I currently use chat GPT to plan my Ironman training. Honestly, we'll see if I have enough time to actually put towards it. It's in about three months now. But Luke Hoplife, awesome dude. Ironman training hybrid athlete, influencer guy. A lot of opportunity to build a hybrid training application and market it with guys like him. Clean your it. All right, that's crazy. I think I've told you guys before that sometimes you get emergence capabilities in most English models. It's one of their signature things. Translation was an emerging capability in most language models. You get a true how they could trust you. Emergence is like one of the most interesting concepts. They just were certain scale and they had enough language data and they just could do it very, very, very well. Now we have a new emotional capability. This is an images and movies, veil three, VEO three. What up, Posey? Can't take. Yeah, that's a lot. It's like that you draw on a total of two. You can use mine later. I'm filming by the way. Say hi. What up, boys? Let's give it in. All right, I don't, this guy's too fucking boring. But like AI creators, always interesting dudes to work with. Door competitor. All right, all right, all right. Fuck it, let me on that. Edmond some hot girl doing some shit. Okay. That's probably enough of me scrolling. I'd encourage, and I think that there will be an assignment about this. Scroll through, come up with ideas as you scroll. For me, it's obviously like my for you page and the ideas that I think of are very confined within the realm of self improvement. Right, this is just me. This is who I am. Sure, every individual watching this has different things that they deeply understand and deeply care about. For some of y'all, it might be teaching people how to code and making a new wave AI coding tutor that you can use on your phone in your free time for teenagers. For other people, it might be, it might be female mental health. I don't know what things that you care about are, things that you have particular interest in, but you social media to identify the content that is already doing well. And then once you have your idea, which I didn't do here, but if you have a specific idea in mind, then cure it your entire for you page around that if it is not already curated around it. This is very, very, very, very important. As you come to the conclusion of your idea, if you're a for you page is not already all that content, it should consume your entire for you page. Right now, you see, like, I have a little bit of a random looks, maxing stuff here and there because that was a big part of my life in the past. But when I was building UMACS, every single fucking video, every single one was looks, maxing content. When I was building RizGPT, every single piece of content was RizGPT, when I was building Cal AI at the in the early days, every single piece of content was calorie tracking content. So either cure it your current for you pages to hit it or create new accounts to build around it. All right, that's enough for this lesson. In the next lesson, we will go over Reddit and X.com.
