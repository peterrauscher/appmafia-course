 Okay, so before we move into the next section, which will be where I teach you how to create creatives, this section is going to go over a topic called creative fatigue, which is very important for you to learn. I explained how do you set up the campaign, how to test out your ads, see what's working, and then move it to winners. Now once it's in winners, you can't just assume it's going to work forever, because it will. Every ad has a lifespan, and every ad will eventually be exhausted and have something called creative fatigue. This is when it becomes unprofitable. If you try to spend more, if you try to scale it more, whatever the case, it was super, it was profitable for a while, days, weeks, sometimes even months, and then it slowly becomes less and less profitable until it's just not profitable anymore. This happens with all ads over a long enough time period. No creative is good enough to last indefinitely. And so what you're going to want to do is watch out for this. In the winners' ad set, if an ad is unprofitable for like one or two days, leave it. It's nothing to panic about. There are going to be fluctuations in depending on seasonality and all these different things, just a day-to-day basis you can't look at. But if an ad is unprofitable for an entire week, then it's time to remove it from the winners' ad set completely. Generally, they say you only want to turn ads on and off by clicking this toggle. They say you don't want to actually delete because that can mess up the algorithm. So that's what I would recommend doing. If you get to the point where, because you could only have 50 ads, if you get to the point where you've turned them off, then you've filled up all 50 spaces, which will take you a while to do. But once you've done that, then it's worth, you could create a second winners' ad set here. You could create four ad sets in a campaign. You could create a second winners, third winners, and if you exhaust all of those, you could create another campaign. But by that point, you'll probably want to hire someone who's a lot better than you to run it, or you'll have learned a lot more on your own. Let's get into creatives in the next topic.
