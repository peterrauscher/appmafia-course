  "text": " Okay, so I just wanted to touch briefly now on Apple search ads. Prior to this, everything we went through, that's pretty applicable to all major paper-click ad platforms. Google, Snapchat ads, Facebook, which includes Instagram and, well, meta, which includes Instagram and Facebook. And TikTok ads basically all run in a very similar way. It works campaign, ad set ads. And so, Apple search ads is very different. Apple search ads are ads in places like shown here. You can see, oops, okay, so you'd see ads that come up in the suggested area when you first go in the app store. When you look up a keyword, something will come up at the top. In today, you can see an ad. Also, at the bottom of other apps, you will see other recommended apps. So, when you look up, for example, Cal AI, at the top, there is an ad that comes up because people bid on our keywords. So, there's actually this app that's super knowing a clone app called CalDi-Ai that is bidding on the word Cal AI. Now, we bid on it too. We have it about 50 to 60% of the time. You is very hard to get it 100% of the time. If you want to be like someone reasonably, like, break even or anything. But yeah, it's like these things turn into bidding wars and dog fights over inventory very, very quickly. So, two websites that you'll really need for this is the Apple search ads. And they have an advanced mode. They also have a basic mode. I'm not going to go too in depth or really that in depth at all really into setting this up. I'd suggest if you want to just get off the ground running, maybe just do the basic mode, you can look into how to get more advanced yourself. But if you do actually want to run the strategy and start running up, a lot of downloads from Apple search ads, I would recommend the platform search ad optimization.com. Essentially, it helps with AI and all kinds of stuff to help you optimize your bids. We're actually on the website because we use them. I really like the founder. He's a cool guy. He spent a lot of time and care building out this platform. He's also always willing to help people on it. So, it's a small team, not the many people that use it right now. The platform is great. It helps you do keyword research and helps you with a lot of research insights, anything you need in order to basically figure out which keywords you should start bidding on. Basically, the whole strategy comes down to grouping keywords into different groups, grouping keywords, and then bidding on those keywords together. So, for example, here we are bidding, and this is unprofitable, and calorie trucker and calorie counter. We are the reason we are doing this, and spending 2.5K a day, I'm zoomed in right now, I'm ID guys. So, we are bidding on these two words, calorie counter and calorie trucker, unprofitably right now. We only have about a 50% of ROAS because we're trying to get higher on the ranks. When you look up calorie trucker or calorie counter. Honestly, I think we're bidding a little too high, I just sent the message to the guy on our team who runs this, and we're going to try to be more profitable on this. But you can see the green is the revenue, the blue is what we're spending. I'm making it a little more clear. It's three days a day because we have the three day free trial, but then you'll see we're losing money on this, a few hundred dollars a day. And we have our brand keywords, and this is the brand protection element we were talking about. Other people are bidding on the term Kaliai, and our impression here is only 50% of the time. So, the other 50, it's like these random clone apps that are just copying us. We're spending 2K a day on this. We could spend more and protect it more, get more than 50%. But honestly, I don't think like a long, long term, we're going to be hurt by these low quality clones bidding on us. And they're definitely not profitable, so it's not a big risk for us. But then there's discovery broad groups where I believe it actually goes out and finds keywords for you. And this is great because then you just give it a budget, it will find keywords and it will spend. And this whole thing, it has an AI optimizer. So, every three days, this will automatically change our budgets for everything to make sure that we are profitable, which is very cool. I heavily recommend this platform. I am just really quick. There's two features here on how to do it. I'm not going to do a full guide. But the two core things you need to know is scaling up or down the max cost per tap, the max you're willing to bid for someone to click on your app, and then also changing the price. And it's this, or not the price, but how much you're willing to spend per day. And it's this balance of daily budget versus the max cost per tap, that first of all gives you the impression share and the row-os that you want. If your max cost per tap is too low, then you actually will just not spend any of this. You could see if the budget's too low, you'll see right here, our max cost per tap is $1.11, and other people are bidding more than us. So we are barely spending. We said you're allowed to spend up to 2.2K, but it's only spending $462. Definitely look more into this if you're interested. It's a, I think Apple search ads are definitely worth the investment. Early on, I would be careful with, I showed a bunch of different distribution platforms through this, Conor showed some as well. I would pick one and go hard on it. If you try to do all of them at once, you're more likely to fail at each one individually. I think we're good here. I think we are anything else I'm missing, maybe not. Maybe, I mean, I know I didn't go that in depth in this, but I'm honestly not too much of an expert, otherwise that would have. It's just about finding the right keywords and then bidding. Okay, so you guys in the next section.",
