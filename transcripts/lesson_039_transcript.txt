 Let's jump into how to do some influencer marketing before we start. Let's go through some case studies So this is my app on Blake's app Cal AI So get some of our videos 700 calories. It's that bright eggs and bacon 50 grams of protein 55 fat one of the cool things about the Cal AI with traveling I get a lot of people kind of knock it because it only like the whole take a picture of your food track your calories But if you want to track it exactly by weight has the same database my fitness pal But you can put in a description of what you're eating so like a lot of times They're not been going out of but like fruit bowl with like Greek yogurt and it will give me like a rough estimate But at least it still have somewhat of an idea what I'm eating while traveling since I can't weigh anything because of eating out of Every single meal there's multiple things you can do in the app. It's not just a calorie picture app You can use like actual databases. So this is one of our influencers Alex Ubank who's pretty famous very well known in the fitness community There's another video that got a million views What I eat and what I eat and the other pretty popular girl and kids are I think she was on That was a lot more of a seamless You Not even saying in Kalei or anything in the video. She's just showing us news and other awesome stuff. Oh, that's insane. Oh, and all that all we are calling out now to get never looking at. That's insane. Oh, what's in front of me. Oh, thanks. Oh, well, thanks, Patrick. Oh, notice people are commenting what app we're using. Cool. Let's go to another one. Andrew Maxer. 13 million views. Cool. Yo, three shows the problem. Should like, solution for problems. Okay. 13 million views right there. Another one. Oh, this is it. Is this quitter? That was quitter. We'll get to that one. But last Kalei, I video. I'm trying to show you guys different varieties of how we do influencer helping in Kalei. We have some cruders that talk to the camera about Kalei. Some cruders that show a day in their life of what they're doing, they just casually throw on Kalei. Some people are chefs. They make their food. And then they scan to see how many Kalei's their food is with Kalei. They have to show the whole recipe. And yeah, other people are asking like, okay, what app do you use? So big thing of the food strategy, but we'll get into all of the nuances. So that's like a few different types of videos from Kalei and our strategy. Quitter is very similar. Let's see some of their viral videos. 17 million views. By the way, I just want to say I didn't pull like our most viral videos. I think our most viral video to date probably is like 20, 30 million views. I'm not sure. But I just want to show what the what you can. What the average or typical videos we have usually are. Okay, let's go to Quitter. This is like kind of a cinematic video. Kind of like sad, sad, melancholy music. Beautifully shot. It really tells the story well. Now this person was going to watch porn, but then now they used Quitter. Notice how this isn't like this video. By the way, sponsored by Quitter guys are doing dropped. But if you're trying to quit porn download our app. I actually really recommend it guys. Thank you back to the video. No, it's not like that. That's what you might find on YouTube. For short form influencer marketing, you do not want to do that. That is not good. See this count. Pretty famous 1.4 million followers. Let's go through another. Jeremiah Jones also an influencer for Cal AI on this guy. Excuse me. I think it was so hot and you have an amazing body. What are you doing? Shoot in my shot. How about doing a movie? On me. What are you doing? 30 minutes. Be outside. We're going to go right? I don't know if that's time to get some footage. It does show Quitter. And that causes a lot of conversions. Okay. Let's go through another. This is actually this video specifically was massively viral for them. I got 10 million views. But it was I believe their most their highest converting video out of all videos. This video got brought them over 100,000 dollars in just two days. This video will 100,000 dollars from this video. Let's watch it. Notice it's like always the same screen that these apps are shot for Cal AI. It's taken picture of your food. For Quitter, it's the panic button. These are the features where someone is very visual. You see it. Wow. And I understand what this app does on the canteen right now. Let's look at it. What happens is that people are telling him. Okay. So we just went through two apps of hours. And I'm going to show that other apps are doing this too. It actually this used to be something that really only indeed. I just developers were doing is influencer marketing because it's a very untabbed space. The fact that you're learning about this, you have a massive advantage. No one knows how to do this. No one does. Except a few people like us. But some big companies are now starting to dip their toes in the water. Like Block Blast, for example. It is not a utility app like Cal AI or Quitter. It's a game. And I think they're one of the only games that are doing influencer marketing. And it's working amazing for them. So one million views. Let's see. Now Block Blast, we can party. You have a best friend. You're a last best friend. You have a gap. Stop it. Block Blast. You know, I'm always getting the high scores with her. She's just amazing. She's beautiful. And she always keeps me entertained. I've been through a lot these past few years. And Block Blast has always been there with me. Look at my high score. If that's not true friendship, I don't know what is. I can play Block Blast anywhere anytime. It's amazing. It's always there for me. So you're having a birthday party for an app. Yeah, don't say app like that. It's a long video. But essentially, it's clearly an influencer marketing video for Block Blast. Got a million views. A lot of people about to start playing this now 169 likes. A lot of people downloaded the app because of this video. And by the way, referencing one of the last units, let's just go through quickly. I want to say the hook. What's this hook here? It's the really urgency as a hook. She's setting something up. You don't know what she's setting up. You're curious and something urgent is happening. Cool. And she shows Block Blast. And there's one more video that will go through another Block Blast video. So these are all kinds of different videos that display how influencer marketing can be done. It all shows the scale. It could lead to $100,000 and 48 hours just from one single video being done right. And you can really scale this at Cali. We have like 30 videos going out every single day. And so we're sustainably getting a few million views a day, which lead to a bunch of downloads every single day and a bunch of revenue. I think yesterday we did around 100k, $100,000 in sales. And this is primarily from influencer marketing. So let's move on to the next section now that you can see the possibilities of what influencer marketing can do.
