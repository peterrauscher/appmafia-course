 All right, Posys. You guys close your first influencer, what's next? Well, all you have to do is manage and track them to make sure that they're posting consistently and their content needs your requirements. So you've added them to your CRM, you're in a group chat with them, what's next? Pretty simple, the contract, right? We put that in the materials below. All you have to do is set up the contract, their name, their address, their contract size, which is their deal. So whether that's two grand for a million views, when they be paid out and the posting schedule, how you recommend them throwing all that in the contract. So there's no miscommunication on when things be posted, when they're paid, and anything that could eventually hurt you in the long run. But I wouldn't overthink this, there's a template, it's really simple, put that in the materials below. Next, they sound the contract, all you have to do is pay them, right? So if you're on a smaller scale, you have less than five influencers, highly recommend using PayPal or Venmo, if you're sending roughly just a couple thousand dollars a month. If you are sending more than a couple thousand dollars a month, you're handling five plus your 10, 15, 20 influencers, highly recommend using platform like Groey, which will have a whole section to showing you how to set up Groey, use Groey for performance tracking, to payment, to campaigns, etc. And the fourth thing is performance tracking. For now, if you're on the smaller scale, less than five influencers, I would just put it on Google Sheets, right? Set it up, influencer name, accounts, average views, what they're aiming to get, and when they're going to post, and then just put the link in there, and you can sum it up at the end of the month. When it comes to the schedule, and this is generally put in the contract, you say one video per week for four weeks. I don't recommend saying like every Monday because a lot of the times things get delayed, and they might not feel comfortable with that. So I generally in the onboarding call, make sure it's like hay or planning for Mondays, but you have a two day grace period. And it's your job to follow up on that Friday, Saturday, Sunday, how in the for that video, make the video reach requirements. When it comes to content requirements, the app needs to show the show in the first 15 to 20 seconds, and the content needs to be native to their audience. You can't be posting a video that makes no sense, right? The video has to be something that they normally post with it to day in the life, right? Think Kalei, whether it's Quitter or it's showing like how to become a dog and self development, and quitting porn is one of those things. And the last thing, which I think is the most important thing, is your aha moment, alright? This needs to be a clear engaging moment, which is a feature of your app, alright? A scroll stopping moment. Now think Kalei, that is scanning food. Whenever someone's watching a video a day in the life of fitness influence, with like holy shit, I can use AI to scan my food and get these calories done in seconds, and don't waste five to ten minutes, and log my fucking calories like a loser. For Quitter, it's the panic button, right? We say, look, if you have urges, which a lot of young men have, click the panic button, it walks you through it, it makes you actually look like an idiot if you guys have ever seen it. Another thing, community feature for us, alright? On Quitter, a lot of the fitness influencers and religious creators we work with always say like, you're three ways you can quit lust, three ways to change your life, a big one's sprouting yourself through community, and so they push the community feature on the app. Think about your app and what features can integrate in their content. That is going to make you win this game. Now, tracking on a more specific note, like I said, less than five creators, use a Google sheet, right? You don't need to overcomplicate this. Five plus use growing, automatically the key tracks, views, manage campaigns, you can schedule payouts, you can basically scale up without worrying about when to pay someone, how many views they get, and worrying about us also contracts, growing hands contracts. Now, when it comes to your workflow, I would say if you plan for Monday, makes you follow up on Saturday or Sunday to confirm the content is prepared, if they send it to you, you review it, it's good, you validate it, they can post it. Make sure it needs to guidelines. A lot of these influencers, much stack multiple deals in cut corners, you can't let them cut corners, that's why they're a contract. It's also why I highly recommend paying 20% on front. Now, there is a world where you're in a very competitive industry like Cal AI, for example, where everyone's trying to get the fitness influencers, alright? So they pay up front because they can't afford to lose an influencer. At the end of the month, right? So you have week one, they post, week two, they post, week three, they post, week four, they post. I highly recommend waiting a full week after their fourth post to total the views, make sure the view guaranteed was hit, release this final payment, and discuss the adjustments the next month, what if they don't hit the agreed view guarantee, what if they blow it out of the water, like I want to up this, up it, right? The whole point of this is to make sure that you are getting accurate data, which is fair for the influencer and fair for yourself. Boom, I got it.
