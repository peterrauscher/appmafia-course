 All right, here we go. Setting up your account, all right? Everyone over thinks this, it's very simple. All you're looking to do is have clarity and trust within your branded account on Instagram and TikTok. So first things first, clear logo. Don't over complicate it. Don't make it something stupid. Just have a clear logo of what you guys are. Next thing is, right? Call AI is a calorie tracker, quitter is how you quit porn. Next thing we say is, Call AI has fast, simple and accurate, right? There's three value ads. Our value is you quit porn in 30 days. And then social validation. We have over a million happy users, Call AI is over five million happy users. Now, if you don't have over a million happy users, you can say over 10,000 happy users. You can use other things to show you social validation. At the end of the day, you just want to position yourself as a authentic, real and trustworthy solution in space. Because when someone looks at your organic content, you can repost and account your influence or content. They're going to come to your account and be like, oh, wow, they're legit. They're not just some random app. And a lot of this time, you can supercharge this with your distributions. You can have influence or swallow your page, influence or collaborate on posts. When it comes to collaborative posts, I would highly recommend waiting for the influencer to post and wait a week before you said collaborate on it. Because they could stump engagement if your account doesn't have enough reach. And then I would do the same thing for TikTok.
